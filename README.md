#  What I did in this project?
While I was learning German, I watched movies with subtitles. To compare the English and German subtitles, I decided to create a program using Python that could extract only the necessary content and produce pure text.

The program follows these steps:

1-Reads the text from an English subtitle file in the .srt format

2-Uses regex to detect specific and similar text

3-Extracts only the necessary parts of the subtitle

4-Repeats the above steps for the German subtitle file

With this program, I was able to effectively compare the English and German subtitles and improve my language learning.
