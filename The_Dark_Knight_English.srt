2
00:01:03,300 --> 00:01:04,559
Three of a kind. Let's do this.

3
00:01:05,109 --> 00:01:06,237
That's it? Three guys?

4
00:01:06,238 --> 00:01:08,867
Two guys on the roof.
Every guy gets a share.

5
00:01:08,867 --> 00:01:09,868
Five shares is plenty.

6
00:01:09,869 --> 00:01:12,456
Six shares. Don't forget the
guy who planned the job.

7
00:01:12,457 --> 00:01:14,801
He thinks he can sit it out
and still take a slice?

8
00:01:14,802 --> 00:01:16,734
I know why they call him the Joker.

9
00:01:16,734 --> 00:01:18,045
So why do they call him the Joker?

10
00:01:18,323 --> 00:01:19,462
I heard he wears makeup.

11
00:01:19,462 --> 00:01:20,463
Makeup?

12
00:01:20,464 --> 00:01:22,201
Yeah! to scare people.
You know, warpaint?

13
00:01:34,656 --> 00:01:36,938
Alright everybody, hands up
heads down!

14
00:01:38,442 --> 00:01:40,924
I said, hands up,
heads down!

15
00:01:40,924 --> 00:01:44,102
Let's go pal! I'm
making a withdrawal here.

16
00:01:44,102 --> 00:01:46,063
Put your hands up!

17
00:01:46,498 --> 00:01:47,946
Here comes the silent alarm.

18
00:01:48,769 --> 00:01:49,939
There it goes.

19
00:01:49,939 --> 00:01:50,941
Heads down!

20
00:01:54,130 --> 00:01:55,833
Get down. I said stay
down there!

21
00:01:56,803 --> 00:02:00,207
That's funny it didn't dial out to 911.
I was trying to reach a private number.

22
00:02:00,207 --> 00:02:01,065
Is it a problem?

23
00:02:01,066 --> 00:02:02,067
No, I'm done here ...

24
00:02:20,822 --> 00:02:25,933
Obviously we don't want you doing anything
with your hands other than holding on for dear life.

25
00:02:34,246 --> 00:02:36,220
On the ground! Stay on the ground!

26
00:02:36,221 --> 00:02:38,797
Nobody make a move! Nobody!

27
00:02:38,798 --> 00:02:40,169
Stay down!

28
00:02:56,283 --> 00:02:56,993
Come here!

29
00:02:59,935 --> 00:03:02,257
Do you have any idea who
you're stealing from?

30
00:03:02,415 --> 00:03:03,933
You and your friends are dead!

31
00:03:03,934 --> 00:03:05,651
He's out, right?

32
00:03:18,362 --> 00:03:19,948
Where did you learn to count?

33
00:03:22,838 --> 00:03:25,074
They wired this thing up with like 5000 Volts.

34
00:03:25,075 --> 00:03:26,077
What kind of bank does that?

35
00:03:26,077 --> 00:03:27,078
A mob bank.

36
00:03:27,079 --> 00:03:29,491
I guess the Joker is
as crazy as they say.

37
00:03:29,492 --> 00:03:30,493
Where is the alarm guy?

38
00:03:30,494 --> 00:03:33,065
The boss told me when the guy
was done, I should take him out.

39
00:03:33,302 --> 00:03:34,984
One less share, right?

40
00:03:35,797 --> 00:03:38,130
Funny ... He told me something similar.

41
00:03:38,131 --> 00:03:39,714
He what? No, no!

42
00:03:51,979 --> 00:03:56,851
That's a lot of money. If this Joker guy was so
smart he'd had us bring a bigger car.

43
00:03:58,458 --> 00:04:02,092
I'm betting the Joker told you to kill
me as soon as we loaded the cash.

44
00:04:03,339 --> 00:04:06,457
No, no, no, no ...
I kill the bus driver.

45
00:04:07,661 --> 00:04:08,798
Bus driver?

46
00:04:10,734 --> 00:04:12,171
What bus driver?

47
00:04:16,588 --> 00:04:18,348
School's out. Time to go.

48
00:04:18,751 --> 00:04:20,355
Cat's not getting up, is he?

49
00:04:21,748 --> 00:04:22,855
That's a lot of money.

50
00:04:26,675 --> 00:04:28,265
What happened to the rest of the guys?

51
00:04:36,120 --> 00:04:37,346
You think you're smart, huh?

52
00:04:38,823 --> 00:04:40,606
Well, the guy that hired you

53
00:04:40,988 --> 00:04:42,878
will just do the same with you.

54
00:04:44,127 --> 00:04:47,004
Ah, criminals in this town used
to believe in things.

55
00:04:47,005 --> 00:04:52,482
Honor, respect! Look at you!
What do you believe in?

56
00:04:52,481 --> 00:04:54,336
Huh, what do you believe in?

57
00:04:54,337 --> 00:04:58,908
I believe whatever doesn't kill
you simply makes you...

58
00:05:01,042 --> 00:05:02,881
stranger.

59
00:05:45,308 --> 00:05:48,473
Mr. Mayor, you were elected in
the campaign to clean up the city.

60
00:05:48,474 --> 00:05:49,476
When are you going to start?

61
00:05:49,476 --> 00:05:50,796
Well, Mike, I believe I already have.

62
00:05:50,797 --> 00:05:53,098
Like the so-called Batman? We're
hearing that he's doing some good.

63
00:05:53,098 --> 00:05:54,812
That criminals are running scared.
But I say ...

64
00:05:54,813 --> 00:05:56,758
Nah, man... I don't like it tonight.

65
00:05:57,300 --> 00:05:58,591
What are you? Superstitious?

66
00:05:58,592 --> 00:06:01,179
You got more chance of winning
the powerball than running into him.

67
00:06:01,179 --> 00:06:03,439
That simply is not true.
I'm told that

68
00:06:03,440 --> 00:06:04,945
Our men in the major crimes unit
are close to ...

69
00:06:04,946 --> 00:06:07,825
Mayor says you're closing
in on the Batman.

70
00:06:08,389 --> 00:06:10,862
The investigation is ongoing.

71
00:06:19,778 --> 00:06:21,920
Ever intending to see your wife
again, lieutenant?

72
00:06:21,921 --> 00:06:24,242
I thought you had to go
look after your mother, detective?

73
00:06:24,904 --> 00:06:26,229
Checked her back into the hospital.

74
00:06:27,275 --> 00:06:28,147
Sorry.

75
00:06:29,564 --> 00:06:30,625
So he hasn't shown up?

76
00:06:30,969 --> 00:06:32,122
I hope he doesn't.

77
00:06:32,975 --> 00:06:35,071
I like reminding everybody
that he's out there.

78
00:06:35,402 --> 00:06:36,522
Why wouldn't he come?

79
00:06:36,523 --> 00:06:39,946
Hopefully because he is busy.

80
00:06:57,143 --> 00:06:59,603
That's why we bring dogs.

81
00:07:00,286 --> 00:07:02,282
Hey, my filhotinhos.

82
00:07:06,384 --> 00:07:08,381
Look what your drugs
did to my customers.

83
00:07:09,426 --> 00:07:13,925
Buyer beware. I told you
my compound would take you places.

84
00:07:14,454 --> 00:07:17,199
I never said they'd be places
you wanted to go.

85
00:07:17,360 --> 00:07:19,656
My business repeat customers.

86
00:07:20,029 --> 00:07:22,965
If you don't like what I have to offer
you can buy from someone else.

87
00:07:23,907 --> 00:07:26,545
Assuming Batman left
anyone to buy from...

88
00:07:30,350 --> 00:07:32,965
My dogs are hungry!

89
00:07:37,623 --> 00:07:40,088
Pity there is only one of you.

90
00:07:48,835 --> 00:07:49,811
That's not him.

91
00:08:08,141 --> 00:08:09,369
That's more like it.

92
00:09:38,500 --> 00:09:39,983
Don't let me find you out here again.

93
00:09:40,529 --> 00:09:41,662
We are trying to help you.

94
00:09:42,019 --> 00:09:42,950
I don't need help!

95
00:09:43,224 --> 00:09:44,444
Not my diagnosis.

96
00:09:44,917 --> 00:09:45,860
What gives you the right?

97
00:09:46,539 --> 00:09:48,017
What's the difference between you and me?

98
00:09:48,546 --> 00:09:50,498
I'm not wearing hockey pads.

99
00:09:59,121 --> 00:10:01,283
He can't resist showing us
his face.

100
00:10:06,580 --> 00:10:08,086
What's he hiding
under that makeup?

101
00:10:16,521 --> 00:10:18,471
Can we get a minute,
people, please?

102
00:10:21,400 --> 00:10:23,795
Him again?
Who were the others?

103
00:10:23,795 --> 00:10:25,385
Another bunch of smalltimers.

104
00:10:26,530 --> 00:10:28,228
Some of the marked
bills I gave you.

105
00:10:28,229 --> 00:10:30,641
My detectives have been making
drug buys with them for weeks.

106
00:10:30,641 --> 00:10:33,594
This bank puts another draft of the mob.
That makes five.

107
00:10:33,594 --> 00:10:35,204
We found a bulk of the dirty cash.

108
00:10:35,205 --> 00:10:36,371
Time to move in.

109
00:10:36,372 --> 00:10:40,661
We would have to hit all banks
simultaneously. Swat teams, backup.

110
00:10:40,661 --> 00:10:42,432
What about this Joker guy?

111
00:10:42,433 --> 00:10:45,467
One man or the entire mob?
He can wait.

112
00:10:45,467 --> 00:10:47,856
When the new DA hears
about this, he'll want in.

113
00:10:47,935 --> 00:10:49,177
Do you trust him?

114
00:10:49,178 --> 00:10:53,544
It'd be hard to keep him out.
I hear he is as stubborn as you are.

115
00:11:37,957 --> 00:11:40,080
It would be nice when Wayne
manor is rebuilt.

116
00:11:41,389 --> 00:11:45,448
You can swap not sleeping in a penthouse
to not sleeping in a mansion.

117
00:11:45,642 --> 00:11:49,681
Whenever you stich yourself up
you do make a bloody mess.

118
00:11:49,681 --> 00:11:52,415
Yeah. It makes me
learn from my mistakes.

119
00:11:52,611 --> 00:11:55,249
You ought to be pretty
knowledgable by now.

120
00:11:57,761 --> 00:12:02,511
My armor. Carrying too
much weight. I need to be faster.

121
00:12:02,808 --> 00:12:04,500
I'm sure Mr. Fox
can oblige.

122
00:12:05,640 --> 00:12:07,236
Did you get mauled by a tiger?

123
00:12:07,237 --> 00:12:08,238
It was a dog.

124
00:12:08,239 --> 00:12:10,132
- Ah?
- It was a big dog.

125
00:12:11,654 --> 00:12:14,742
More copycats last night,
Alfred. With guns.

126
00:12:14,742 --> 00:12:16,978
Why don't you hire them
and take a weekend off?

127
00:12:16,978 --> 00:12:22,450
That wasn't ... exactly what I had in mind
when I said I wanted to inspire people.

128
00:12:22,451 --> 00:12:23,452
I know.

129
00:12:24,058 --> 00:12:27,444
But things have improved.
Look at the new district attorney.

130
00:12:28,600 --> 00:12:30,536
I am. Closely.

131
00:12:30,924 --> 00:12:32,579
I need to know if he can be trusted.

132
00:12:33,078 --> 00:12:36,418
Are you interested in his character
or ... his sexual circle?

133
00:12:41,382 --> 00:12:44,000
Who Rachel spends her time
with is her business.

134
00:12:45,888 --> 00:12:48,118
I trust you don't have
me followed on my day off.

135
00:12:48,118 --> 00:12:49,462
If you ever took
one I might.

136
00:12:52,008 --> 00:12:53,914
Know your limits, Master Wayne.

137
00:12:53,915 --> 00:12:56,889
Batman has no limits.

138
00:12:57,315 --> 00:12:58,566
Well you do, sir.

139
00:12:58,567 --> 00:13:00,347
Well, I can't afford to know them.

140
00:13:00,347 --> 00:13:02,695
What's going to happen on
the day that you find out?

141
00:13:02,696 --> 00:13:05,558
We'll all know how much you
like to say: "I told you so"

142
00:13:05,558 --> 00:13:10,776
On that day, Master Wayne, even
I won't want to. Probably.

143
00:13:17,862 --> 00:13:19,133
Sorry I'm late, folks.

144
00:13:23,307 --> 00:13:24,285
Where were you?

145
00:13:24,285 --> 00:13:25,579
Worried you'd have to step up?

146
00:13:25,580 --> 00:13:28,108
Harvey, I know these
briefs backwards.

147
00:13:28,109 --> 00:13:33,046
Fair's fair.
Heads, I'll take it. Tails, he's all yours.

148
00:13:33,046 --> 00:13:35,479
Oh yeah? You want to flip a coin
to see who leads?

149
00:13:35,479 --> 00:13:36,591
It's my father's lucky coin.

150
00:13:36,982 --> 00:13:38,994
As I recall, it got me my
first date with you.

151
00:13:38,994 --> 00:13:41,091
You wouldn't leave something
like that up to chance.

152
00:13:42,438 --> 00:13:45,357
I don't.
I make my own luck.

153
00:13:46,926 --> 00:13:50,363
All rise!
The Honorable Judge Surrillo presiding.

154
00:13:51,319 --> 00:13:53,722
I thought the DA just plays
golf with the mayor or things like that.

155
00:13:53,871 --> 00:13:57,726
Tee-off is 1:30. More than enough time
to put you away for life, Salli.

156
00:13:57,826 --> 00:14:01,652
With Carmine Falcone in Arkham, someone must have
stepped up to run this so-called family.

157
00:14:03,478 --> 00:14:09,246
Is that man in this courtroom today?
Could you identify him for us please?

158
00:14:09,474 --> 00:14:11,467
You win, counsellor.

159
00:14:13,127 --> 00:14:14,488
It was me!

160
00:14:16,389 --> 00:14:20,277
I have a sworn statement
from you, that this man,

161
00:14:20,278 --> 00:14:24,047
Salvatore Maroni, is the new
head of the Falcone crime family.

162
00:14:24,346 --> 00:14:28,340
Maroni? He is a fallguy!
I'm the brains of the organization.

163
00:14:29,650 --> 00:14:30,402
Order, order!

164
00:14:30,852 --> 00:14:31,983
Permission to treat
the witness as hostile.

165
00:14:32,053 --> 00:14:32,403
Granted.

166
00:14:32,503 --> 00:14:34,326
Hostile?
I'll show you hostile!

167
00:14:39,910 --> 00:14:42,714
Carbon fiber,
.28 caliber, made in China.

168
00:14:42,715 --> 00:14:45,957
If you want to kill a public servant, Mr. Maroni,
I recommend you buy American.

169
00:14:47,615 --> 00:14:48,817
Get him out of here!

170
00:14:49,267 --> 00:14:50,418
But, your honor, I'm not done!

171
00:14:53,910 --> 00:14:55,823
We will never be able to link
the gun to Maroni,

172
00:14:55,824 --> 00:14:57,852
so we won't be able to
charge him, but the fact

173
00:14:57,876 --> 00:15:00,413
they are trying to kill you,
means we are getting to them.

174
00:15:00,413 --> 00:15:03,768
Well I'm glad you're so pleased Rachel.
And I'm fine, by the way.

175
00:15:03,768 --> 00:15:06,351
Come on Harvey, you are Gotham's DA!
If you are not getting shot at,...

176
00:15:06,361 --> 00:15:07,883
you're not doing your job right.

177
00:15:08,745 --> 00:15:12,987
But you know, he said if you were rattled
you could take the rest of the day off.

178
00:15:12,988 --> 00:15:16,640
I can't. I dragged the Head of
the major crimes unit down here.

179
00:15:16,714 --> 00:15:20,644
Jim Gordon? He's a friend actually,
try to be nice!

180
00:15:30,251 --> 00:15:32,654
I hear you got a
hell of a right cross.

181
00:15:36,354 --> 00:15:38,673
It's a shame Sal's gonna walk.

182
00:15:38,673 --> 00:15:40,119
Yeah, well good thing about the mob is...

183
00:15:40,120 --> 00:15:41,839
They keep giving you second chances.

184
00:15:47,816 --> 00:15:52,421
Lightly radiated bills.
Fancy stuff for a city cop.

185
00:15:52,639 --> 00:15:53,270
Have helped?

186
00:15:53,401 --> 00:15:55,395
We have links with various agents ...

187
00:15:55,395 --> 00:15:57,183
Save it Gordon, I want to meet him.

188
00:15:57,184 --> 00:16:00,841
Official policy is to arrest the
vigilante known as Batman on sight.

189
00:16:00,907 --> 00:16:03,438
Uhum ... And what about that floodlight
on the top of MCU?

190
00:16:03,458 --> 00:16:06,249
If you've got problems
with malfunctioning equipment,

191
00:16:06,249 --> 00:16:08,570
I suggest you take them up
with maintenance counselor.

192
00:16:09,183 --> 00:16:12,072
I put every known money launderer
in Gotham, behind bars,

193
00:16:12,072 --> 00:16:13,694
but the Mob is still getting its money.

194
00:16:14,998 --> 00:16:18,591
I think you and your friend,
have found the last game in town

195
00:16:18,591 --> 00:16:22,033
and are trying to hit them where it hurts:
their wallets. That's bold.

196
00:16:23,720 --> 00:16:24,846
You gonna count me in?

197
00:16:25,248 --> 00:16:28,408
In this town the fewer people know
something, the safer the operation.

198
00:16:28,507 --> 00:16:30,996
Gordon, I don't like that you've got your
own special unit and

199
00:16:31,090 --> 00:16:33,964
I don't like that is full of cops
I investigated at internal affairs.

200
00:16:33,964 --> 00:16:38,588
If I had to work with cops you investigated while you
were licking your name at IAIP working alone.

201
00:16:39,308 --> 00:16:41,256
I don't get political points
for being an idealist.

202
00:16:41,256 --> 00:16:43,109
I have to do the best I can
with what I have.

203
00:16:46,826 --> 00:16:49,314
You want me to back warrants
for search and seizure

204
00:16:49,315 --> 00:16:52,641
on five banks without telling
me what we're after?

205
00:16:53,569 --> 00:16:56,572
Well, I can give you
the names of the banks.

206
00:16:57,087 --> 00:16:58,276
Well, that's a start.

207
00:16:59,085 --> 00:17:01,377
I'll get you your warrants,
but I want your trust.

208
00:17:01,777 --> 00:17:05,851
You don't have to sell me, Dent. We all
know you're Gotham's white knight.

209
00:17:07,331 --> 00:17:09,983
I heard they have a different name
for me down at MCU.

210
00:17:10,703 --> 00:17:12,134
I wouldn't know about that.

211
00:17:13,237 --> 00:17:16,980
In China, Lau Security Investments
stands for dynamic new growth.

212
00:17:17,188 --> 00:17:21,144
The joint Chinese venture with
Wayne Enterprises will be a powerhouse.

213
00:17:21,542 --> 00:17:26,008
Well, Mr Lau. I speak
for the rest of the board ...

214
00:17:27,431 --> 00:17:29,998
And Mr. Wayne,
in expressing our own excitement.

215
00:17:35,073 --> 00:17:39,307
Sir, I know that Mr. Wayne is curious
about how his trust fund gets replenished

216
00:17:39,358 --> 00:17:41,299
But frankly ...
This is embarrasing!

217
00:17:41,559 --> 00:17:43,622
You worry about the delegace,
Mr. Reese.

218
00:17:44,267 --> 00:17:45,829
I'll worry about Bruce Wayne.

219
00:17:46,913 --> 00:17:50,048
It's done.
The numbers are solid.

220
00:17:50,347 --> 00:17:54,718
Do them again. Wouldn't want the
trust fund to run out, now would we?

221
00:17:57,953 --> 00:18:03,178
Another long night? This joint venture
was your idea and the consultants love it.

222
00:18:03,477 --> 00:18:07,731
But I am not convinced. Lau's company
has grown by 8% anually like clockwork.

223
00:18:08,360 --> 00:18:12,174
His revenue stream must be
off the books. It may be even illegal.

224
00:18:12,855 --> 00:18:14,446
OK, cancel the deal.

225
00:18:15,678 --> 00:18:17,128
You already knew?

226
00:18:17,358 --> 00:18:19,852
I just needed a closer look at their books.

227
00:18:20,454 --> 00:18:22,125
Anything else you can trouble me for?

228
00:18:22,720 --> 00:18:23,595
I need a new suit.

229
00:18:24,423 --> 00:18:26,997
Yeah ... 3 buttons is a little
90's, Mr. Wayne.

230
00:18:27,276 --> 00:18:30,489
I am not talking fashion
Mr Fox, so much as function.

231
00:18:31,215 --> 00:18:35,169
- Want to be able to turn your head?
- Sure would make backing out of the driveway easier.

232
00:18:35,535 --> 00:18:36,964
I'll see what I can do.

233
00:18:42,190 --> 00:18:44,237
It took me 3 weeks to
get a reservation here.

234
00:18:44,237 --> 00:18:46,336
And I had to tell them
I work for the government.

235
00:18:46,370 --> 00:18:47,085
Really?

236
00:18:47,086 --> 00:18:49,157
This city health inspector is
not afraid to pull strings.

237
00:18:49,541 --> 00:18:51,553
Rachel!
Fancy that!

238
00:18:51,886 --> 00:18:54,625
Yeah Bruce, fancy that.

239
00:18:54,853 --> 00:18:56,862
Rachel, Natasha.
Natasha, Rachel.

240
00:18:56,610 --> 00:19:01,916
- Natasha, are you the. ..
- The prima ballerina from the Moscow ballet.

241
00:19:02,286 --> 00:19:03,828
Wow, Harvey's
taking me next week.

242
00:19:04,331 --> 00:19:06,029
Really?
So you're into ballet?

243
00:19:06,423 --> 00:19:08,700
Bruce, this is Harvey Dent.

244
00:19:09,001 --> 00:19:12,584
The famous Bruce Wayne.
Rachel's told me everything about you.

245
00:19:12,766 --> 00:19:13,973
Well, I certainly hope not.

246
00:19:14,595 --> 00:19:16,110
So, let's put a couple of tables together.

247
00:19:16,611 --> 00:19:20,155
- I'm not sure that they'll let us.
- Oh they should. I own the place.

248
00:19:21,289 --> 00:19:23,847
How could want to raise children
in a city like this?

249
00:19:23,847 --> 00:19:26,378
Well, I was raised here.
I turned out OK.

250
00:19:26,730 --> 00:19:28,208
Is Wayne manor in the city limits?

251
00:19:29,236 --> 00:19:31,640
The Palisades.

252
00:19:31,708 --> 00:19:32,796
You know as our new DA,

253
00:19:32,797 --> 00:19:35,677
you might want to figure out
where your jurisdiction ends.

254
00:19:36,506 --> 00:19:40,462
I'm talking about the kind of city
that idolizes a masked vigilante.

255
00:19:40,547 --> 00:19:43,899
Gotham City is proud of an ordinary
citizen standing up for what's right.

256
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:46,539
Gotham needs heroes
like you, elected officials.

257
00:19:46,540 --> 00:19:48,203
And not a man who
thinks he's above the law.

258
00:19:48,295 --> 00:19:50,367
- Exactly. Who appointed the Batman?
- We did.

259
00:19:50,626 --> 00:19:54,030
All of us who stood by
and let scum take control of our city.

260
00:19:54,039 --> 00:19:55,730
But this is a democracy, Harvey.

261
00:19:55,859 --> 00:19:57,418
When their enemies were at the gates,

262
00:19:57,419 --> 00:20:00,926
the Romans would suspend democracy
and appoint one man to protect the city.

263
00:20:01,502 --> 00:20:04,277
It wasn't considered an honor.
It was considered a public service.

264
00:20:04,343 --> 00:20:08,554
Harvey, the last man that they appointed
to protect the republic was named Caesar,

265
00:20:08,553 --> 00:20:09,904
and he never gave up his power.

266
00:20:10,473 --> 00:20:13,644
OK, fine.
You either die a hero...

267
00:20:13,743 --> 00:20:16,434
or you live long enough to see
yourself become the villain.

268
00:20:16,836 --> 00:20:21,292
Look. Whoever the Batman is, he doesn't
want to do this for the rest of his life.

269
00:20:21,362 --> 00:20:24,058
Batman is looking for someone
to take up his mantle.

270
00:20:24,174 --> 00:20:29,519
- Someone like you, Mr. Dent?
- Maybe. If I'm up to it.

271
00:20:29,518 --> 00:20:34,029
- What if Harvey Dent is
the caped crusader?

272
00:20:36,693 --> 00:20:39,946
- If I were sneaking out every night,
someone would have noticed by now.

273
00:20:42,449 --> 00:20:46,632
Well ... I'm sold that I'm going
to throw you a fundraiser.

274
00:20:46,788 --> 00:20:49,855
That's nice of you Bruce, but
I'm not up for reelection for 3 years.

275
00:20:50,004 --> 00:20:53,587
No, you don't understand.
One fundraiser with my pals,

276
00:20:55,088 --> 00:20:56,855
you'll never need another cent.

277
00:21:11,873 --> 00:21:13,485
What the hell is this?

278
00:21:15,651 --> 00:21:18,742
As you all are aware, one of
our deposits was stolen.

279
00:21:18,961 --> 00:21:22,205
A relatively small amount.
68 million.

280
00:21:22,631 --> 00:21:25,205
Who is stupid enough to steal from us?

281
00:21:25,205 --> 00:21:28,728
2-bit wackjob, wears a cheap
purple suit and makeup.

282
00:21:29,246 --> 00:21:30,800
He's not the problem.
He's a nobody.

283
00:21:31,193 --> 00:21:34,493
The problem is our money
being tracked by the cops.

284
00:21:34,712 --> 00:21:36,864
Thanks to Mr. Maroni's
well placed sources,

285
00:21:36,865 --> 00:21:39,615
we know that police have
indeed identified our banks

286
00:21:39,795 --> 00:21:43,910
using marked bills and are planning
to seize your funds today.

287
00:21:44,010 --> 00:21:48,308
And since the enthusiastic new DA has
put all my competitors out of business,

288
00:21:48,308 --> 00:21:50,435
I'm your only option.

289
00:21:50,486 --> 00:21:51,643
So what do you propose?

290
00:21:52,277 --> 00:21:54,602
Moving all deposits
to one secure location.

291
00:21:54,999 --> 00:21:56,799
- Not a bank.
- Where then?

292
00:21:56,800 --> 00:21:58,663
Nobody can know, but me.

293
00:21:58,663 --> 00:22:03,684
If the police were to gain leverage over one
of you, everyone's money would be at stake.

294
00:22:03,887 --> 00:22:05,893
What stop them getting to you?

295
00:22:05,893 --> 00:22:08,900
I go to Hong Kong.
Far from Dent's jurisdiction

296
00:22:09,578 --> 00:22:11,853
And the Chinese will not extradite
one of their own.

297
00:22:12,803 --> 00:22:14,307
How soon can we move the money?

298
00:22:14,584 --> 00:22:16,146
I already have.

299
00:22:18,127 --> 00:22:20,651
For obvious reasons, I couldn't
wait for your permission.

300
00:22:21,241 --> 00:22:24,334
Rest assured your money is safe.

301
00:22:37,493 --> 00:22:39,725
And I thought my
jokes were bad.

302
00:22:39,754 --> 00:22:42,649
Give me one reason why I shouldn't
have my boy here pull your head off.

303
00:22:42,738 --> 00:22:44,208
How about a magic trick?

304
00:22:47,499 --> 00:22:50,188
I'm going to make
this pencil disappear.

305
00:22:52,056 --> 00:22:56,715
Tahdah! It's gone!

306
00:22:57,810 --> 00:23:00,041
Oh, and by the way,
the suit, it wasn't cheap.

307
00:23:00,041 --> 00:23:01,831
You ought to know,
you bought it!

308
00:23:02,213 --> 00:23:06,609
Easy.
I want to hear the opposition.

309
00:23:09,820 --> 00:23:12,317
Let's wind the clock back a year.

310
00:23:12,318 --> 00:23:17,644
These cops and lawyers wouldn't dare
cross any of you.

311
00:23:20,899 --> 00:23:24,217
What happened?
Did your balls drop off?

312
00:23:26,130 --> 00:23:29,361
- You see a guy like me ...
- A freak!

313
00:23:31,798 --> 00:23:39,306
A guy like me ..
I know why you choose to have

314
00:23:39,906 --> 00:23:45,827
group therapy sessions in broad daylight.
I know why you're afraid to go out at night.

315
00:23:47,840 --> 00:23:54,751
The Batman. Batman has shown Gotham
your true colors, unfortunately.

316
00:23:55,107 --> 00:23:57,894
Dent, he's just the beginning.

317
00:23:59,210 --> 00:24:03,945
And as for the television's
so-called plan ...

318
00:24:03,946 --> 00:24:08,873
The Batman has no jurisdiction.
He'll find him and make him squeal.

319
00:24:08,969 --> 00:24:11,982
I know the squealers when I see them.

320
00:24:14,772 --> 00:24:19,266
- What do you propose?
- It's simple. We kill the Batman.

321
00:24:20,167 --> 00:24:23,091
If it is so simple why
haven't you done it already?

322
00:24:23,291 --> 00:24:25,844
If you are good thing at something,
never do it for free.

323
00:24:26,337 --> 00:24:27,795
And what you want?

324
00:24:28,781 --> 00:24:30,832
Hm ... Half.

325
00:24:32,279 --> 00:24:37,376
- Are you crazy!
- No I'm not ... No, I'm not.

326
00:24:39,304 --> 00:24:47,124
If we don't deal with this now,
soon little Gamble here

327
00:24:47,123 --> 00:24:50,068
won't be able to get a
nickel for his grandma.

328
00:24:50,314 --> 00:24:52,533
Enough from the clown!

329
00:24:52,534 --> 00:24:57,536
Let's not blow this out of proportion.

330
00:24:57,536 --> 00:25:00,523
Do you think you can
steal from us and just walk away?

331
00:25:00,557 --> 00:25:04,675
I'm putting a word out: 500 grand
for this clown dead.

332
00:25:04,675 --> 00:25:08,023
A million alive, so I can
teach him some manners first.

333
00:25:08,727 --> 00:25:12,426
Alright, so listen.
Why don't you give me a call when

334
00:25:12,427 --> 00:25:18,222
you wanna start taking things
a little more seriously? Here's my card.

335
00:25:37,901 --> 00:25:41,240
You're a hard man to reach.

336
00:25:42,918 --> 00:25:45,008
Lau is halfway to Hong Kong.

337
00:25:46,931 --> 00:25:48,517
If he had asked,
I could have taken his passport.

338
00:25:48,517 --> 00:25:50,014
I told you to keep me in the loop.

339
00:25:50,049 --> 00:25:53,758
All that was left in the vaults were
marked bills. They knew we were coming.

340
00:25:53,758 --> 00:25:55,738
As soon as your office got involved ...

341
00:25:55,772 --> 00:25:56,815
My office?

342
00:25:56,816 --> 00:26:00,114
You're sitting down there with scum like
Wuertz and Ramirez and you're talking ...

343
00:26:00,991 --> 00:26:04,346
Oh yeah Gordon, I almost had your rookie
cold on a racketeering beef.

344
00:26:04,350 --> 00:26:07,872
Don't try and cloud the fact that clearly
Maroni's got people in your office, Dent.

345
00:26:11,930 --> 00:26:12,891
We need Lau back.

346
00:26:14,018 --> 00:26:16,873
But the Chinese won't extradite
a National under any circumstances.

347
00:26:18,185 --> 00:26:21,108
If I get him to you,
can you get him to talk?

348
00:26:21,124 --> 00:26:22,910
I'll get him to sing.

349
00:26:22,153 --> 00:26:24,290
We're going after the mob's life savings.

350
00:26:25,262 --> 00:26:26,633
Things will get ugly ...

351
00:26:27,004 --> 00:26:29,195
I knew the risk
when I took this job, lieutenant.

352
00:26:29,395 --> 00:26:30,636
How will you get him back ...

353
00:26:33,448 --> 00:26:34,806
He does that.

354
00:26:35,200 --> 00:26:38,553
Our Chinese friends left town before I
could tell them the deal was off.

355
00:26:38,672 --> 00:26:41,565
Well I'm sure you've always
wanted to go to Hong Kong.

356
00:26:42,775 --> 00:26:43,721
What's wrong with a phone call?

357
00:26:44,972 --> 00:26:48,111
I think Mr Lau
deserves a more ... personal touch.

358
00:26:49,810 --> 00:26:54,282
Now for high altitude jumps, you're
gonna need oxygen and stabilizers.

359
00:27:01,461 --> 00:27:03,407
But what about getting back into the plane?

360
00:27:03,890 --> 00:27:05,675
I'd recommend a good travel agent.

361
00:27:05,575 --> 00:27:06,986
Without it landing.

362
00:27:08,691 --> 00:27:11,111
Now that's more like it, Mr. Wayne.

363
00:27:12,048 --> 00:27:17,750
The ClA had a program back in the 60's for getting
their people out of hot spots called skyhook

364
00:27:18,334 --> 00:27:22,670
You could look into that.
Okay, now.

365
00:27:24,011 --> 00:27:27,012
Hardened Kevlar plates over
titanium-tipped

366
00:27:27,013 --> 00:27:29,498
triweaved fibers for flexibility.

367
00:27:29,745 --> 00:27:32,837
You'll be lighter,
faster, more agile.

368
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:38,551
Perhaps you should read the instructions first.

369
00:27:39,042 --> 00:27:40,130
Now there is a tradeoff.

370
00:27:40,130 --> 00:27:44,019
Separation of the plates makes you
more vulnerable to knives and gunfire.

371
00:27:44,054 --> 00:27:46,359
We wouldn't want to make
things too easy now, would we?

372
00:27:47,084 --> 00:27:49,226
How will it hold up against dogs?

373
00:27:49,511 --> 00:27:51,914
We talking Rotweilers or Chiuauas?

374
00:27:52,885 --> 00:27:54,729
It should do fine against cats.

375
00:27:55,265 --> 00:27:57,321
I found one in Arizona.

376
00:27:57,745 --> 00:28:01,852
An very nice man said he could have it up
and running in a week and he'd take the cash.

377
00:28:02,222 --> 00:28:03,239
What about a flight crew?

378
00:28:03,240 --> 00:28:07,701
South Korean smugglers; they run flights
into Pyongyang below radar the whole way.

379
00:28:07,700 --> 00:28:08,702
Did you think of an alibi?

380
00:28:08,877 --> 00:28:10,069
Oh, yes.

381
00:28:19,389 --> 00:28:23,080
Presentation cancelled

382
00:28:29,113 --> 00:28:31,445
I believe this is your plane, sir!

383
00:28:35,499 --> 00:28:38,712
You look tired, Alfred.
Will you be all right without me?

384
00:28:40,926 --> 00:28:44,170
If you can tell me the Russian for:
Apply your own bloody suntan lotion.

385
00:28:55,367 --> 00:28:59,629
Yo Gamble, somebody here for you.
They say they've just killed the Joker.

386
00:28:59,868 --> 00:29:01,671
And they brought the body.

387
00:29:18,833 --> 00:29:20,186
Dead, that's 500 ...

388
00:29:22,002 --> 00:29:23,899
How about alive?

389
00:29:27,386 --> 00:29:29,818
You want to know how I
got these scars?

390
00:29:32,005 --> 00:29:38,132
My father was a drinker and a fiend.

391
00:29:39,202 --> 00:29:43,205
One night he goes off
crazier than usual

392
00:29:43,614 --> 00:29:46,254
Mommy gets the kitchen knife
to defend herself.

393
00:29:46,654 --> 00:29:51,170
He does not like that.
Not one bit.

394
00:29:52,175 --> 00:29:58,920
So, me watching, he takes the
knife to her, laughing while he does it.

395
00:29:59,568 --> 00:30:05,372
He turns to me and he says:
Why so serious, son?

396
00:30:06,673 --> 00:30:09,116
He comes at me with the knife ...

397
00:30:09,182 --> 00:30:15,600
Why so serious, son? He sticks
the blade in my mouth:

398
00:30:16,342 --> 00:30:19,843
Let's put a smile on that face!

399
00:30:26,129 --> 00:30:27,474
Why so serious?

400
00:30:32,470 --> 00:30:42,346
Now, our operation is small but there is a
lot of potential for aggressive expansion.

401
00:30:42,345 --> 00:30:46,126
So, which of you fine gentleman
would like to join our team?

402
00:30:46,945 --> 00:30:48,744
There's only one spot open right now.

403
00:30:48,778 --> 00:30:52,907
So we're going to
have tryouts?

404
00:30:57,585 --> 00:30:59,171
Make it fast.

405
00:31:09,381 --> 00:31:10,785
Welcome to Hong Kong, Mr. Fox.

406
00:31:10,786 --> 00:31:13,471
Mr Lau regrets he isn't able
to greet you in person today.

407
00:31:13,794 --> 00:31:15,081
I understand.

408
00:31:25,229 --> 00:31:28,604
For security purposes, I'm going to
have to ask you to check in your mobile.

409
00:31:29,236 --> 00:31:30,662
Of course

410
00:31:33,265 --> 00:31:36,654
I must apologize for leaving
Gotham in the middle of our negotiations.

411
00:31:36,654 --> 00:31:40,542
This misunderstanding
with the Gotham police force.

412
00:31:40,913 --> 00:31:43,194
I couldn't let such a thing
threaten my company.

413
00:31:43,203 --> 00:31:43,951
Of course.

414
00:31:43,877 --> 00:31:46,200
A businessman of your stature
will understand

415
00:31:46,201 --> 00:31:50,204
that with you here now,
we can continue.

416
00:31:51,374 --> 00:31:55,115
Well I do appreciate you bringing me
out here in such style Mr Lau ...

417
00:31:56,546 --> 00:32:00,743
- We do not allow cell phones in here.
- Oh sorry, forgot I had it.

418
00:32:01,123 --> 00:32:06,193
I really came to tell you that
our business deal has to be put on hold.

419
00:32:06,373 --> 00:32:13,069
We can't afford to be seen to do business
with ... whatever it is you're accused of being.

420
00:32:13,073 --> 00:32:15,670
I'm sure a businessman of
your stature will understand.

421
00:32:15,885 --> 00:32:19,671
I think Mr Fox, a
simple phone call might have sufficed.

422
00:32:19,848 --> 00:32:21,180
Mr. Wayne didn't want
you to think that

423
00:32:21,180 --> 00:32:23,201
he was deliberately
wasting your time.

424
00:32:23,269 --> 00:32:25,146
Just accidentally wasting it.

425
00:32:26,140 --> 00:32:29,887
That's very good Mr Lau.
Accidentally, very good.

426
00:32:30,650 --> 00:32:31,543
Hey, sir!

427
00:32:49,959 --> 00:32:52,011
A better view from the train.

428
00:32:52,212 --> 00:32:58,181
- How's the view from LSl hallways?
- Restricted. Lau has held up the networking tight.

429
00:32:58,280 --> 00:33:00,459
- What is this?
- I had RND work it up.

430
00:33:00,460 --> 00:33:03,755
It sends out a high frequency pulse
records in response time.

431
00:33:03,755 --> 00:33:05,039
For mapping an environment.

432
00:33:05,192 --> 00:33:10,596
- Sonar, just like a ...
- a submarine, Mr. Wayne.

433
00:33:10,597 --> 00:33:12,933
- And the other device?
- It's in place.

434
00:33:13,786 --> 00:33:16,996
Mr Wayne, good luck.

435
00:34:56,203 --> 00:34:57,529
Where are the police?

436
00:34:57,823 --> 00:34:58,499
They are coming.

437
00:34:58,652 --> 00:35:00,450
Then what the hell
am I paying them for?

438
00:37:01,312 --> 00:37:02,837
Please deliver to Lieutenant Gordon.

439
00:37:07,070 --> 00:37:10,530
Look, give us the money
and we'll talk about making a deal.

440
00:37:10,874 --> 00:37:13,589
The money is the only reason
I am still alive.

441
00:37:14,214 --> 00:37:18,180
Oh, you mean when they find out
that you've helped us they're going to kill you?

442
00:37:18,180 --> 00:37:19,732
Are you threatening my client?

443
00:37:19,732 --> 00:37:23,508
No, I'm just assuming your
client's cooperation with this investigation.

444
00:37:26,279 --> 00:37:27,438
As well everyone.

445
00:37:28,881 --> 00:37:31,784
No?
Okay.

446
00:37:32,899 --> 00:37:35,285
Enjoy your time in county Mr Lau.

447
00:37:35,972 --> 00:37:39,245
Wait.
I won't give you the money.

448
00:37:39,899 --> 00:37:42,964
But I will give you my clients.
All of them.

449
00:37:42,965 --> 00:37:49,493
You were a glorified accountant. What could you
possibly have on all of them that we could charge?

450
00:37:49,492 --> 00:37:53,316
I'm good with calculation.
I handled all the investments.

451
00:37:53,535 --> 00:37:54,847
One big pot.

452
00:37:56,679 --> 00:37:59,499
- Got it.
- One minute.

453
00:38:01,124 --> 00:38:05,788
If they pull their money we can
charge them all as one crew on conspiracy.

454
00:38:05,788 --> 00:38:06,789
Charge them with what?

455
00:38:07,143 --> 00:38:10,535
In a Reiko case, if you can charge one
of the conspirators with a felony, you can ...

456
00:38:10,535 --> 00:38:12,360
Charge all of them with it. That's great.

457
00:38:14,161 --> 00:38:21,053
Mr Lau. What kind of details do you
have about this communal fund?

458
00:38:21,053 --> 00:38:22,054
Edgers, notebooks ...

459
00:38:21,797 --> 00:38:24,663
Immunity, protection and a
chartered plane back to Hong Kong.

460
00:38:24,663 --> 00:38:26,332
After you testify in open court.

461
00:38:26,503 --> 00:38:29,588
And I'm just curious.
with all your clients locked up,

462
00:38:29,622 --> 00:38:31,139
what's going to happen with all that money?

463
00:38:31,632 --> 00:38:34,920
Like I said, I am
good with calculation.

464
00:38:34,921 --> 00:38:39,708
He can't go to county,
I'll keep him here in the holding cells.

465
00:38:39,708 --> 00:38:41,494
What is this Gordon, your fortress?

466
00:38:42,404 --> 00:38:47,035
- Do you trust them over at county?
- I don't trust them here.

467
00:38:48,969 --> 00:38:50,351
Lau stays.

468
00:38:50,956 --> 00:38:55,128
Well, I don't know about Mr. Lau's travel
arrangements, but I'm sure glad he's back.

469
00:38:55,882 --> 00:38:58,331
He would, we should
have hired the clown.

470
00:39:00,922 --> 00:39:06,320
He was right, we have to
fix real problem. Batman.

471
00:39:10,973 --> 00:39:13,401
I'm not aware of any participation
by the Batman in the investigations.

472
00:39:13,401 --> 00:39:15,481
Our boy looks good on the tube

473
00:39:15,397 --> 00:39:18,280
You sure you want to embarrass me
in front of my friends lieutenant?

474
00:39:18,280 --> 00:39:21,206
No, don't worry.
They're coming too.

475
00:39:29,272 --> 00:39:31,003
Have a nice trip. See you in the next fall.

476
00:39:31,305 --> 00:39:35,463
712 counts of extortion,
849 counts of racketeering,

477
00:39:35,462 --> 00:39:40,722
246 counts of fraud,
87 counts of conspiracy, murder ...

478
00:39:42,007 --> 00:39:46,952
527 counts of obstruction of justice.
How do the defendants plead?

479
00:39:53,745 --> 00:39:55,159
Order in court.

480
00:39:55,160 --> 00:40:00,276
549 criminals at once. How did you
convince Surrillo to hear this farce?

481
00:40:00,276 --> 00:40:04,824
She shares my enthusiasm
for justice. After all she is a Judge.

482
00:40:04,824 --> 00:40:07,950
Even if you blow enough smoke
to get convinctions out of Surrillo,

483
00:40:07,950 --> 00:40:10,799
you're going to set a new record
in appeals for quickest tick in the ass.

484
00:40:10,833 --> 00:40:15,191
It won't matter, the head guys make bail,
sure. But the midlevel guys, they can't.

485
00:40:16,127 --> 00:40:18,617
They can't afford to be off
the streets long enough for trial and appeal,

486
00:40:18,618 --> 00:40:20,192
they'll cut deals that include some jailtime.

487
00:40:20,298 --> 00:40:23,217
Think of all you can do
with 18 months of clean streets.

488
00:40:24,887 --> 00:40:26,035
Mr. Mayor, you can't ...

489
00:40:26,036 --> 00:40:27,811
Get out, both of you.

490
00:40:32,241 --> 00:40:33,141
Sit down.

491
00:40:38,737 --> 00:40:41,809
The public likes you.
That's the only reason that this might fly.

492
00:40:41,809 --> 00:40:46,026
But that means it's on you. They are all going
to come after you now and not just the mob.

493
00:40:46,026 --> 00:40:52,630
Politicians, journalists, cops. Anyone
whose wallet is about to get lighter.

494
00:40:53,249 --> 00:40:57,742
Are you up to it? You better be,
because if they get anything on you

495
00:40:57,741 --> 00:41:02,775
and those criminals are back on the streets ...
Followed swiftly by you and me.

496
00:41:25,072 --> 00:41:27,591
I think your fundraiser will
be a great success sir.

497
00:41:27,592 --> 00:41:29,971
And why do you think I want to
hold a party for Harvey Dent?

498
00:41:29,971 --> 00:41:33,344
Well, I assumed it was your
usual reason for socializing

499
00:41:33,344 --> 00:41:35,681
beyond myself and the scum
of Gotham's underbelly.

500
00:41:35,681 --> 00:41:37,573
To try to impress Miss Dawes.

501
00:41:37,574 --> 00:41:42,748
Very droll, but very wrong.
Actually it's Dent.

502
00:41:42,748 --> 00:41:44,862
The police disclosed the footage
found at scene of the body.

503
00:41:44,863 --> 00:41:47,744
Sensitive viewers please be aware:
the image is disturbing.

504
00:41:47,944 --> 00:41:51,111
- Tell them your name.
- Brian.

505
00:41:53,279 --> 00:41:58,870
- Are you the real Batman?
- No! No!

506
00:41:58,870 --> 00:42:01,518
Then why do you dress up like him?

507
00:42:06,242 --> 00:42:11,368
- He's a symbol... that we don't have to be afraid of scum like you!
- Yeah, you do, Brian. You really do!

508
00:42:15,255 --> 00:42:19,819
So you think Batman has
made Gotham a better place?

509
00:42:27,826 --> 00:42:31,230
You see this is how crazy
Batman has made Gotham.

510
00:42:31,358 --> 00:42:37,980
If you want to order in Gotham the Batman
must take off his mask and turn himself in!

511
00:42:38,734 --> 00:42:42,056
And every day he doesn't,
people will die!

512
00:42:42,604 --> 00:42:48,225
Starting tonight.
I'm a man of my word.

513
00:43:04,933 --> 00:43:11,373
Harvey Dent, scourge of the underworld,
scared stiff by the trust fund brigade.

514
00:43:11,375 --> 00:43:12,775
- I'll be back.
- Rachel!

515
00:43:12,776 --> 00:43:14,874
A little liquid courage,
Mr Dent?

516
00:43:16,556 --> 00:43:18,461
- Alfred, right?
- That's right, sir.

517
00:43:18,461 --> 00:43:21,613
Rachel talks about you all the time.
You've known her for her whole life?

518
00:43:21,613 --> 00:43:22,730
Not yet, sir.

519
00:43:25,417 --> 00:43:27,778
Any psychotic ex-boyfriends
I should be aware of?

520
00:43:27,779 --> 00:43:29,599
Oh, you have no idea!

521
00:43:48,541 --> 00:43:52,709
I'm sorry that I'm late, but I'm glad
to see that you all got started without me.

522
00:43:52,909 --> 00:43:59,190
Now, where is Harvey?
Where is Harvey Dent, the man of the hour!

523
00:43:59,190 --> 00:44:03,358
And where's Rachel Dawes,
she is my oldest friend. Come here.

524
00:44:03,358 --> 00:44:07,480
When Rachel first told me that she was
dating Harvey Dent, I had one thing to say:

525
00:44:07,480 --> 00:44:11,958
"The guy that was cut off from those awful campaign
commercials, I believe in Harvey Dent? "

526
00:44:11,958 --> 00:44:16,266
Yeah nice slogan, Harvey.
But you caught Rachel's attention.

527
00:44:16,266 --> 00:44:23,082
Then I started to pay attention to Harvey
and all that he's been doing as our new DA.

528
00:44:23,081 --> 00:44:28,426
And you know what?
I believe in Harvey Dent.

529
00:44:28,426 --> 00:44:33,094
I believe that on his watch
Gotham can feel a little safer.

530
00:44:34,090 --> 00:44:36,558
A little more optimistic.

531
00:44:37,422 --> 00:44:41,839
Look at this face.
This is the face of Gotham's bright future.

532
00:44:41,839 --> 00:44:44,529
To Harvey Dent.
Let's hear it for him.

533
00:44:55,472 --> 00:44:58,957
Harvey may not know you well enough
to understand when you are making fun of him.

534
00:44:58,957 --> 00:44:59,958
but I do.

535
00:44:59,601 --> 00:45:01,172
No, I meant every word.

536
00:45:02,359 --> 00:45:07,628
You know that day that you once told me about
when Gotham would no longer need Batman?

537
00:45:07,701 --> 00:45:09,070
- It's coming.
- Bruce ...

538
00:45:10,213 --> 00:45:13,859
- You can't ask me to wait for that.
- It's happening now.

539
00:45:13,859 --> 00:45:15,659
Harvey is that hero.

540
00:45:15,659 --> 00:45:20,245
He locked up half of the city's criminals
and he did it without wearing a mask.

541
00:45:20,612 --> 00:45:23,354
Gotham needs a hero with a face.

542
00:45:24,030 --> 00:45:28,738
You throw a party Wayne, I'll give you that.
Thanks again.

543
00:45:30,075 --> 00:45:31,810
You mind if I borrow Rachel?

544
00:45:36,348 --> 00:45:38,939
Lieutenant, that Joker card
pinned to the body?

545
00:45:38,939 --> 00:45:40,934
Forensics found 3 sets of DNA.

546
00:45:40,969 --> 00:45:42,383
- Any matches?
- All three.

547
00:45:42,384 --> 00:45:45,800
The DNA belongs to Judge Surrillo,
Harvey Dent, and Commissioner Loeb.

548
00:45:45,800 --> 00:45:48,201
The Joker is telling us
who he's targeting.

549
00:45:48,202 --> 00:45:51,076
Get a unit over to Surrillo's house.
Tell Wuertz to find Dent.

550
00:45:51,076 --> 00:45:53,425
Get them both into protective custody.
Where's the commissioner?

551
00:45:53,425 --> 00:45:54,079
City Hall.

552
00:45:54,281 --> 00:45:56,699
Seal the building.
No one in or out until I get there.

553
00:45:56,699 --> 00:45:57,299
Got it.

554
00:46:09,555 --> 00:46:12,775
- Gordon! What are you up to?
- We're secure.

555
00:46:12,775 --> 00:46:15,273
I want a floor by floor
search of the entire building.

556
00:46:15,274 --> 00:46:17,833
Sorry sir, we believe the Joker
has made a threat against your life.

557
00:46:18,068 --> 00:46:19,541
These are dangerous people, Judge.

558
00:46:19,541 --> 00:46:21,662
Yes, but you're not
giving me an awful lot of information.

559
00:46:21,697 --> 00:46:24,359
- Even we don't know where you're going.
- Take the envelope.

560
00:46:24,359 --> 00:46:26,774
Get in, open it. It'll tell
you where you're headed.

561
00:46:30,839 --> 00:46:32,677
You can not leave me alone
with these people.

562
00:46:32,736 --> 00:46:35,908
The whole mob is after you
and you're worried about these guys?

563
00:46:35,909 --> 00:46:37,998
Compared to this,
the mob doesn't scare me.

564
00:46:38,198 --> 00:46:41,445
Gordon, you're unlikely
to discover this for yourself, so..

565
00:46:41,995 --> 00:46:46,237
Take my word, the Police Commissioner
there's a lot of threats.

566
00:46:46,237 --> 00:46:51,240
I found the appropriate response
to these situations a long time ago.

567
00:46:51,973 --> 00:46:54,186
Them gunning for you
makes you see things clearly.

568
00:46:54,186 --> 00:46:55,261
Yeah, I bet.

569
00:46:55,262 --> 00:46:59,534
Yeah, it makes you think
about things you couldn't stand losing.

570
00:47:00,519 --> 00:47:02,394
About who you want to
spend the rest of your life with.

571
00:47:02,395 --> 00:47:03,696
It's a pretty big commitment.

572
00:47:03,839 --> 00:47:05,277
Well, not if the Mob has their way.

573
00:47:10,546 --> 00:47:15,750
It'd be good to explain to my wife
why I'm late for dinner tonight.

574
00:47:15,750 --> 00:47:18,578
Sir, the Joker card
had traces of your DNA on it.

575
00:47:20,512 --> 00:47:25,234
- Don't do that.
- Alright. Let's be serious then.

576
00:47:25,791 --> 00:47:28,515
- Okay.
- What's your answer?

577
00:47:34,204 --> 00:47:36,517
I don't have an answer.

578
00:47:37,922 --> 00:47:39,307
How'd they get my DNA?

579
00:47:39,308 --> 00:47:41,144
Somebody with access to your
office or your house

580
00:47:41,145 --> 00:47:43,367
must have lifted a tissue
or a glass...

581
00:47:43,402 --> 00:47:44,198
Wait!

582
00:47:44,531 --> 00:47:46,743
- I guess the answer is no.
- Harvey ...

583
00:47:47,223 --> 00:47:49,217
- It's someone else, isn't it?
- Harvey!

584
00:47:49,494 --> 00:47:52,095
Just tell me it's not Wayne,
the guy's a complete…

585
00:47:53,204 --> 00:47:54,939
What are you doing?

586
00:48:13,135 --> 00:48:14,871
Get a medic!

587
00:48:20,871 --> 00:48:21,979
We made it!

588
00:48:27,893 --> 00:48:31,195
Good evening, ladies and gentlemen.

589
00:48:33,986 --> 00:48:37,160
We are tonight's entertainment!

590
00:48:38,858 --> 00:48:40,334
I only have one question.

591
00:48:41,301 --> 00:48:44,066
Where is Harvey Dent?

592
00:48:54,301 --> 00:48:56,632
You know where Harvey is?
You know who he is?

593
00:48:56,603 --> 00:48:58,249
Hands up, pretty boy!

594
00:49:04,792 --> 00:49:06,464
Do you know where I can find Harvey?

595
00:49:06,465 --> 00:49:09,166
I need to talk to him about something,
something little.

596
00:49:09,875 --> 00:49:10,769
No. ..

597
00:49:12,703 --> 00:49:15,201
- What's going on out there?
- Wayne!

598
00:49:17,446 --> 00:49:19,644
Ah, thank God  you've
got a panic room. Wait!

599
00:49:20,459 --> 00:49:22,186
You got to be kidding me.

600
00:49:22,516 --> 00:49:27,710
- You know, I'll settle for his loved ones.
- We're not intimidated by thugs!

601
00:49:29,119 --> 00:49:34,676
You know, you remind me of my father.

602
00:49:35,968 --> 00:49:39,547
- I hated my father!
- Okay stop!

603
00:49:43,881 --> 00:49:51,312
Well, hello beautiful!
You must be Harvey's squeeze!

604
00:49:53,062 --> 00:49:54,988
And you are beautiful.

605
00:50:02,246 --> 00:50:05,517
You look nervous.
Is it the scars?

606
00:50:07,267 --> 00:50:08,931
You want to know how I got them?

607
00:50:10,340 --> 00:50:12,553
Come here.
Hey!

608
00:50:13,408 --> 00:50:14,921
Look at me.

609
00:50:15,675 --> 00:50:19,658
So I had a wife, beautiful, like you,

610
00:50:20,598 --> 00:50:27,487
who tells me I worry too much.
Who tells me I ought to smile more.

611
00:50:28,040 --> 00:50:32,902
Who gambles and gets in deep with the sharks

612
00:50:33,865 --> 00:50:38,720
One day, they carve her face.
And we have no money for surgeries.

613
00:50:38,720 --> 00:50:43,662
She can't take it.
I just want to see her smile again, hmm?

614
00:50:45,156 --> 00:50:48,167
I just want her to know
that I don't care about the scars.

615
00:50:48,481 --> 00:50:56,255
So... I stick a razor in my mouth
and do this... to myself

616
00:50:56,645 --> 00:51:03,628
And you know what?
She can't stand the sight of me! She leaves.

617
00:51:04,061 --> 00:51:09,479
Now I see the funny side.
Now I'm always smiling!

618
00:51:12,548 --> 00:51:16,021
A little fight in you.
I like that.

619
00:51:16,021 --> 00:51:17,296
Then you're going to love me.

620
00:51:46,316 --> 00:51:48,870
- Drop the gun.
- Oh, sure!

621
00:51:48,870 --> 00:51:52,227
You just take off your little
mask and show us all who you really are.

622
00:51:58,310 --> 00:52:02,328
- Let her go.
- Very poor choice of words!

623
00:52:24,084 --> 00:52:25,678
Are you alright?

624
00:52:28,557 --> 00:52:30,102
Let's not do that again ...

625
00:52:31,238 --> 00:52:33,318
- Is Harvey okay?
- He's safe.

626
00:52:34,963 --> 00:52:36,026
Thank you

627
00:52:36,748 --> 00:52:37,868
Jim, it's over!

628
00:52:38,003 --> 00:52:40,792
As long as they don't get to Lau,
we've cut off their funds.

629
00:52:40,865 --> 00:52:42,347
But the prosecution is over!

630
00:52:42,348 --> 00:52:46,898
Nobody's standing up in front of a judge while judges
and police commissioners are getting blown away.

631
00:52:47,360 --> 00:52:48,398
What about Dent?

632
00:52:48,599 --> 00:52:50,265
If he's got any sense,
Dent's halfway to Mexico.

633
00:52:50,849 --> 00:52:52,323
So where do you keep your trash?

634
00:52:53,602 --> 00:52:54,703
You're due at court.

635
00:52:55,639 --> 00:52:57,196
I need you alive long enough
to get you under record.

636
00:52:57,708 --> 00:53:00,573
You can't protect me.
You can't even protect yourselves.

637
00:53:00,608 --> 00:53:03,576
If you refuse to cooperate you're
not coming back here, you go to county.

638
00:53:03,971 --> 00:53:06,234
How long you calculate
you'll last in there?

639
00:53:08,001 --> 00:53:10,066
Targeting me won't get
their money back.

640
00:53:10,066 --> 00:53:12,968
I knew the mob wouldn't go down
without a fight, but this is different.

641
00:53:12,989 --> 00:53:15,311
- They've crossed the line.
- You've crossed the line first,sir

642
00:53:15,311 --> 00:53:18,669
You squeezed them, you hammered
them to the point of desperation.

643
00:53:19,328 --> 00:53:23,471
In their desperation, they turned to
a man they didn't fully understand.

644
00:53:25,228 --> 00:53:27,024
Criminals aren't complicated Alfred.

645
00:53:27,655 --> 00:53:29,758
We just need to figure out what he's after.

646
00:53:29,759 --> 00:53:34,560
With respect, master Wayne, perhaps this
is a man you don't fully understand either.

647
00:53:35,105 --> 00:53:38,416
A long time ago I was in Burma.

648
00:53:38,416 --> 00:53:41,710
My friends and I were working
for the local government.

649
00:53:41,835 --> 00:53:44,375
They were trying to buy the
loyalty of tribal leaders by

650
00:53:44,375 --> 00:53:46,933
bribing them with precious stones.

651
00:53:47,423 --> 00:53:52,071
But their caravans were being raided
in a forest north of Yangoon by a bandit.

652
00:53:52,071 --> 00:53:54,476
So, we went looking for the stones.

653
00:53:55,793 --> 00:54:01,206
But in 6 months we never met
anyone who traded with him.

654
00:54:01,593 --> 00:54:08,172
One day, I saw a child playing with
a ruby the size of a tangerine.

655
00:54:09,077 --> 00:54:14,120
- The bandit had been throwing them away.
- So why steal them?

656
00:54:14,120 --> 00:54:16,166
Well, because he thought
it was good sport.

657
00:54:16,167 --> 00:54:20,540
Because some men aren't looking
for anything logical, like money.

658
00:54:20,929 --> 00:54:25,698
They can't be bought, bullied,
reasoned, or negotiated with.

659
00:54:25,697 --> 00:54:29,481
Some men just want
to watch the world burn.

660
00:55:07,461 --> 00:55:09,013
Get the names.

661
00:55:15,351 --> 00:55:20,710
- Richard Dent
- Patrick Harvey

662
00:55:21,021 --> 00:55:21,989
Harvey Dent.

663
00:55:22,157 --> 00:55:25,032
I need 10 minutes with the scene
before your men contaminate it.

664
00:55:25,168 --> 00:55:27,503
Us contaminate it? It's because
of you these guys are dead ...

665
00:55:27,503 --> 00:55:28,504
Detective!

666
00:55:30,946 --> 00:55:33,082
Just a minute guys.

667
00:55:34,657 --> 00:55:36,405
It's brick underneath.

668
00:55:36,758 --> 00:55:38,522
You going to take ballistics
off a shattered bullet?

669
00:55:38,522 --> 00:55:43,280
No.
Fingerprints.

670
00:55:49,906 --> 00:55:51,605
Obituaries.
Mayor Anthony Garcia.

671
00:55:51,605 --> 00:55:53,791
Whatever you're going to do,
do it fast.

672
00:55:55,721 --> 00:56:00,352
Because we found his next target.
He's put it in tomorrow's paper.

673
00:56:17,628 --> 00:56:19,741
I'm not sure you
made it loud enough, sir.

674
00:56:32,933 --> 00:56:34,316
What can I do for you Mr Reese?

675
00:56:35,045 --> 00:56:37,848
You wanted me to do the
diligence on the LSI holdings deal again.

676
00:56:39,682 --> 00:56:44,464
- Well, I found some irregularities.
- Our CEO is in police custody.

677
00:56:44,464 --> 00:56:47,357
No, not with their numbers
With yours.

678
00:56:47,752 --> 00:56:48,796
Applied sciences.

679
00:56:48,797 --> 00:56:52,884
A whole division of Wayne
Enterprises just disappeared, overnight.

680
00:56:52,884 --> 00:56:56,474
I went down to the archives and
I started pulling some old files.

681
00:56:57,971 --> 00:56:59,901
Don't tell me you didn't
recognize your baby out there

682
00:56:59,901 --> 00:57:02,622
pancaking cop cars on the evening news.

683
00:57:04,008 --> 00:57:08,074
Now you got the entire RND
department burning through cash

684
00:57:08,075 --> 00:57:10,815
claiming it's related
to cellphones for the army?

685
00:57:10,815 --> 00:57:14,469
What are you building for
him now, a rocket ship?

686
00:57:16,319 --> 00:57:21,840
I want 10 million dollars
a year for the rest of my life.

687
00:57:24,443 --> 00:57:26,463
Let me get this straight.

688
00:57:28,137 --> 00:57:33,980
You think that your client, one of the
wealthiest, most powerful men in the world

689
00:57:33,979 --> 00:57:38,515
is secretly a vigilante, who spends his
nights beating criminals to a pulp ...

690
00:57:38,515 --> 00:57:43,903
... with his bare hands.
And your plan is to blackmail this person?

691
00:57:50,946 --> 00:57:52,348
Good luck.

692
00:57:58,015 --> 00:57:59,131
Keep that.

693
00:58:06,286 --> 00:58:08,190
This is your original scan.

694
00:58:10,056 --> 00:58:11,918
Here it is re-engineered.

695
00:58:20,643 --> 00:58:23,406
And there's the thumbprint he left when
he pushed the round in the clip.

696
00:58:25,846 --> 00:58:27,339
I'll get you a copy.

697
00:58:27,518 --> 00:58:31,887
Mr. Wayne, did you reassign RND?

698
00:58:31,887 --> 00:58:33,923
Yes, government
telecommunications project.

699
00:58:33,924 --> 00:58:36,047
I wasn't aware we had any
government contracts.

700
00:58:36,314 --> 00:58:39,408
Lucius, I'm playing
this one pretty close to the chest.

701
00:58:40,409 --> 00:58:41,923
Fair enough.

702
00:58:45,426 --> 00:58:48,612
With no word from the Batman.
Even as they mourn Commissioner Loeb.

703
00:58:48,613 --> 00:58:51,686
These cops have to be wondering
if the Joker will make good on

704
00:58:51,687 --> 00:58:54,890
his threat in the obituary column of
the Gotham Times to kill the mayor.

705
00:58:57,269 --> 00:59:01,153
I've checked all the databases.
There are four possibles.

706
00:59:01,153 --> 00:59:07,221
Cross reference the addresses. Look
for Park Side, overlooking the parade.

707
00:59:08,873 --> 00:59:14,139
I got one! Melvin White,
1502 Randalf Apartments

708
00:59:14,332 --> 00:59:18,006
Aggravated his soul,
moved to Arkham twice.

709
00:59:57,198 --> 00:59:58,509
How many you got on the roof?

710
00:59:58,987 --> 01:00:01,864
We're tight but frankly
there's a lot of windows up here!

711
01:00:10,949 --> 01:00:14,431
Commissioner Loeb
dedicated his life to

712
01:00:14,432 --> 01:00:17,418
law enforcement and to
the protection of his community.

713
01:00:17,652 --> 01:00:19,411
I remember when I first took office,

714
01:00:19,412 --> 01:00:21,772
I asked him if
he wanted to stay on as Commissioner and...

715
01:00:31,131 --> 01:00:34,508
Clearly he was not a man who minced
words nor should he have been

716
01:00:35,902 --> 01:00:39,813
A number of policies that
he enacted were unpopular.

717
01:00:39,813 --> 01:00:42,922
Policies that flooded
my office with angry calls and letter ...

718
01:00:47,321 --> 01:00:48,991
- Who is it?
- What happened?

719
01:00:50,008 --> 01:00:54,056
They took our guns and uniforms.

720
01:01:03,121 --> 01:01:07,227
We must remember that vigilance
is the price of safety.

721
01:01:07,562 --> 01:01:10,767
Standby, Honor, Guard, Atten-hut.

722
01:01:14,646 --> 01:01:16,168
Ready

723
01:01:16,168 --> 01:01:17,258
Aim

724
01:01:17,846 --> 01:01:19,340
Fire!

725
01:01:20,347 --> 01:01:23,109
Ready, aim ...

726
01:01:25,297 --> 01:01:28,058
Ready, aim ...

727
01:01:39,492 --> 01:01:40,764
Get him out!

728
01:01:50,060 --> 01:01:51,841
- I'll see you later!
- Why are you coming back?

729
01:02:04,478 --> 01:02:05,706
Get out!

730
01:02:10,160 --> 01:02:12,402
Tell me what you
know about the Joker.

731
01:02:42,988 --> 01:02:46,313
- No!
- I'm sorry Barbara.

732
01:02:46,698 --> 01:02:49,716
Junior, go play with
your sister, go ahead.

733
01:02:50,665 --> 01:02:54,750
If there is anything that
I can do, we're here for you.

734
01:02:58,753 --> 01:03:05,858
Are you happy ..Are you
You brought this craziness on us ... You did!

735
01:03:08,746 --> 01:03:12,815
Switch it off, he ain't coming.
He doesn't want to talk to us.

736
01:03:13,924 --> 01:03:16,608
May God help whoever
he does want to talk to.

737
01:03:17,708 --> 01:03:20,556
Can we go some place quieter?
We can't hear each other talk.

738
01:03:21,004 --> 01:03:23,852
Why makes you think
I want to hear you talk?

739
01:03:24,227 --> 01:03:24,946
What?

740
01:03:57,913 --> 01:04:00,282
- Harvey, where are you?
- Where are you?

741
01:04:00,282 --> 01:04:03,821
I'm where you should be at MCU
I'm trying to deal with all this mess.

742
01:04:03,821 --> 01:04:05,021
Can I get the fingerprint analysis?

743
01:04:05,022 --> 01:04:07,855
Rachel, listen to me.
You're not safe there.

744
01:04:07,855 --> 01:04:10,110
- Oh, this is Gordon's unit.
- Gordon's gone, Rachel.

745
01:04:10,111 --> 01:04:12,821
- He vouched for these men.
- And he's gone.

746
01:04:18,001 --> 01:04:20,319
The Joker has named you next.

747
01:04:20,367 --> 01:04:23,303
Is there anyone in this
town we can trust?

748
01:04:23,554 --> 01:04:26,783
Bruce.
We can trust Bruce Wayne.

749
01:04:26,783 --> 01:04:28,790
No Rachel, I know
you're his friend but ...

750
01:04:28,790 --> 01:04:29,791
Harvey, Trust me.

751
01:04:30,609 --> 01:04:33,710
Bruce's penthouse is now
the safest place in the city.

752
01:04:33,711 --> 01:04:37,427
Then you go straight there. Don't tell
anybody where you're going. I'll find you there.

753
01:04:37,427 --> 01:04:38,628
I love you.

754
01:04:52,929 --> 01:04:54,386
I want the Joker.

755
01:04:55,560 --> 01:04:59,992
From one professional to another, if you're
trying to scare somebody, pick a better spot.

756
01:04:59,992 --> 01:05:02,596
From this height, the fall wouldn't kill me.

757
01:05:02,596 --> 01:05:03,747
I'm counting on it.

758
01:05:11,722 --> 01:05:12,638
Where is he?

759
01:05:12,638 --> 01:05:14,939
I don't know where he is.
He found us.

760
01:05:14,940 --> 01:05:18,880
- He must have friends.
- Friends? Have you met this guy?

761
01:05:18,879 --> 01:05:23,150
- Someone knows where he is!
- Nobody's going to tell you nothing.

762
01:05:23,151 --> 01:05:27,414
He was right.
You got rules. The Joker...

763
01:05:27,414 --> 01:05:31,278
He's got no rules.
Nobody's going to cross him for you.

764
01:05:31,278 --> 01:05:35,635
If you want this guy, you got one way.
But you already know what that is.

765
01:05:35,635 --> 01:05:39,171
Just take off that mask
let him come find you.

766
01:05:40,632 --> 01:05:44,315
Or are you going to let a couple more
people get killed while you make up your mind.

767
01:05:46,020 --> 01:05:47,621
You want to play games?

768
01:05:54,758 --> 01:05:55,911
How's that feel?

769
01:05:55,912 --> 01:05:57,855
- Don't kill ...
- I wouldn't?

770
01:05:59,878 --> 01:06:02,830
You don't think I will?
You don't think I will?

771
01:06:04,867 --> 01:06:07,700
No, I wouldn't.

772
01:06:09,207 --> 01:06:11,305
That's why I'm not going
to leave it up to me.

773
01:06:12,860 --> 01:06:20,089
Heads, you get to keep your head.
Tails, not so lucky.

774
01:06:20,089 --> 01:06:22,878
So, you want to tell me about the Joker?

775
01:06:33,126 --> 01:06:36,853
- Let's go again.
- I don't know anything, I don't!

776
01:06:37,170 --> 01:06:41,701
You're not playing the odds, friend.
Let's do it again.

777
01:06:45,064 --> 01:06:49,100
- You'd leave a man's life to chance?
- Not exactly.

778
01:06:49,101 --> 01:06:51,371
His name is Shif, Thomas.

779
01:06:51,371 --> 01:06:55,347
He's a paranoid schizophrenic,
former patient at Arkham.

780
01:06:55,347 --> 01:06:57,047
The kind of mind
that Joker attracts.

781
01:06:57,548 --> 01:06:59,485
What do you expect to learn from him?

782
01:07:03,404 --> 01:07:06,292
The Joker killed Gordon.
He's going to kill Rachel!

783
01:07:06,293 --> 01:07:08,988
You are the symbol of hope
I could never be.

784
01:07:09,188 --> 01:07:11,866
Your stand against organized
crime is the first

785
01:07:11,866 --> 01:07:14,614
legitimate ray of light in
Gotham in decades.

786
01:07:14,649 --> 01:07:17,661
If anyone saw this,
everything would be undone.

787
01:07:18,535 --> 01:07:20,637
All the criminals you pulled off
the streets would be released

788
01:07:20,638 --> 01:07:23,099
and Jim Gordon will have died for nothing.

789
01:07:24,691 --> 01:07:27,733
- You're going to hold a press
conference tomorrow morning.
- Why?

790
01:07:27,733 --> 01:07:31,155
No one else will die because of me.
Gotham is in your hands now.

791
01:07:31,962 --> 01:07:35,425
You can't.
You can't give in.

792
01:07:35,425 --> 01:07:36,426
You can't give in!

793
01:07:53,444 --> 01:07:57,631
Harvey called.
He said Batman's going to turn himself in.

794
01:07:58,115 --> 01:07:59,081
I have no choice.

795
01:07:59,082 --> 01:08:02,674
Do you honestly think that's going to
keep the Joker from killing people?

796
01:08:02,674 --> 01:08:05,384
Maybe not, but I have
enough blood on my hands.

797
01:08:06,491 --> 01:08:11,081
I have seen now what I would have to
become to stop a man like him.

798
01:08:11,994 --> 01:08:14,632
You once told me that if
the day came when I...

799
01:08:14,633 --> 01:08:16,514
was finished, then we would be together.

800
01:08:18,207 --> 01:08:21,259
Bruce, don't make me your
one hope for a normal life.

801
01:08:22,885 --> 01:08:24,148
Did you mean it?

802
01:08:25,694 --> 01:08:26,978
Yes.

803
01:08:47,139 --> 01:08:51,094
If you turn yourself in, they're
not going to let us be together.

804
01:09:02,551 --> 01:09:05,450
- Logs as well?
- Everything.

805
01:09:05,451 --> 01:09:08,618
Anything that can
lead back to Lucius or Rachel.

806
01:09:14,571 --> 01:09:17,664
People are dying Alfred.
What would you have me do?

807
01:09:17,765 --> 01:09:23,059
- Endure ... master Wayne.
- Take it .... They'll hate you for it.

808
01:09:23,467 --> 01:09:27,363
But that's the point of Batman,
he can be the outcast.

809
01:09:27,363 --> 01:09:32,578
He can make the choice that
no one else can make,  the right choice.

810
01:09:32,977 --> 01:09:37,479
Well today I found out what Batman can't do.
He can't endure this.

811
01:09:37,479 --> 01:09:40,082
Today you get to say
"I told you so."

812
01:09:41,184 --> 01:09:43,973
Today, I don't want to.

813
01:09:50,292 --> 01:09:52,082
But I did bloody tell you.

814
01:09:54,795 --> 01:09:59,926
I suppose they'll lock me up as well.
As your accomplice...

815
01:09:59,926 --> 01:10:03,651
Accomplice? I'm going to tell them
the whole thing was your idea.

816
01:10:08,956 --> 01:10:10,408
Ladies and Gentlemen,
Thank you for coming.

817
01:10:10,408 --> 01:10:12,666
I've called this
press conference for two reasons.

818
01:10:12,667 --> 01:10:15,130
Firstly, to assure
the citizens of Gotham that

819
01:10:15,131 --> 01:10:18,639
everything that can be done over
the Joker killings is being done.

820
01:10:19,516 --> 01:10:22,321
Secondly, because the Batman
has offered to turn himself in.

821
01:10:23,019 --> 01:10:24,673
But first, let's consider the situation.

822
01:10:24,673 --> 01:10:26,926
Should we give into
this terrorist's demands?

823
01:10:27,938 --> 01:10:30,924
- Do we really think that ...
- Would you rather protect an outlaw vigilante

824
01:10:30,925 --> 01:10:32,975
... than the lives of citizens?

825
01:10:32,976 --> 01:10:34,483
The Batman is an outlaw.

826
01:10:36,381 --> 01:10:38,309
But that's not why
we're demanding he turn himself in.

827
01:10:38,343 --> 01:10:39,792
We're doing it because we're scared.

828
01:10:39,992 --> 01:10:42,795
We've been happy to let the Batman
clean up our streets for us until now.

829
01:10:42,795 --> 01:10:44,905
Things are worse than ever!

830
01:10:47,379 --> 01:10:48,683
Yes they are ...

831
01:10:51,691 --> 01:10:54,292
But the night is darkest
just before the dawn.

832
01:10:57,447 --> 01:11:01,501
And I promise you ...
the dawn is coming.

833
01:11:01,600 --> 01:11:04,803
One day, the Batman will have to
answer for the laws he's broken.

834
01:11:04,804 --> 01:11:07,757
But to us, not to this madman!

835
01:11:08,379 --> 01:11:09,922
No more dead cops!

836
01:11:13,838 --> 01:11:15,963
He should turn himself in!

837
01:11:21,735 --> 01:11:23,968
So be it.
Take the Batman into custody.

838
01:11:27,269 --> 01:11:28,480
I am the Batman.

839
01:11:39,349 --> 01:11:40,647
Alfred!

840
01:11:42,421 --> 01:11:44,653
Why is he letting Harvey do this?

841
01:11:44,725 --> 01:11:47,492
- He went down to the press conference.
- I know, and he just stoodby!

842
01:11:47,530 --> 01:11:50,832
Perhaps both Bruce and
Mr. Dent believe the Batman

843
01:11:50,869 --> 01:11:54,673
stands for something more important than
the whims of a terrorist, Ms. Dawes.

844
01:11:55,410 --> 01:11:57,438
Even if everyone hates him for it.

845
01:11:57,849 --> 01:11:59,842
That's a sacrifice he's making.

846
01:12:00,253 --> 01:12:03,989
He's not being a hero.
He is being something more.

847
01:12:04,060 --> 01:12:08,865
Yeah, you're absolutely right. Letting Harvey
take the fall for this is not heroic at all.

848
01:12:11,674 --> 01:12:15,113
- You know him better than anyone.
- I do.

849
01:12:17,817 --> 01:12:21,816
Will you give this to him for me?
When the time is right.

850
01:12:22,327 --> 01:12:25,630
- How will I know?
- It's not sealed.

851
01:12:27,134 --> 01:12:28,570
- Bye Alfred.

852
01:12:32,145 --> 01:12:33,739
- Goodbye Rachel.

853
01:12:42,362 --> 01:12:44,629
Sorry, I didn't have time
to talk this through with you ...

854
01:12:44,666 --> 01:12:45,692
What are you doing?

855
01:12:45,769 --> 01:12:47,363
They're transferring me
to Central holding.

856
01:12:48,575 --> 01:12:51,102
This is the Joker's chance. And when
he attacks, the Batman will take him down.

857
01:12:51,179 --> 01:12:53,446
Listen to me, this is too dangerous!

858
01:12:53,484 --> 01:12:55,580
We get this guy to county,
he's their problem.

859
01:12:55,622 --> 01:12:57,615
The streets will be cleared
along your route. Let's go!

860
01:12:57,725 --> 01:13:00,696
Lieutenant, the convoy stops for no reason!

861
01:13:01,397 --> 01:13:02,732
I hope you got some moves pal.

862
01:13:02,733 --> 01:13:05,885
He's using you as bait. He doesn't
even know if he can get the Joker.

863
01:13:05,886 --> 01:13:08,487
- He's failed so far.
- How do you know what he's looking for?

864
01:13:08,487 --> 01:13:09,488
I just, I do!

865
01:13:09,788 --> 01:13:11,543
Anyway Harvey,
this isn't just about you.

866
01:13:11,543 --> 01:13:15,660
What about all the people who are depending on
you to clean the city up and to do it honorably?

867
01:13:22,074 --> 01:13:25,139
Harvey, tell everyone the truth.

868
01:13:25,139 --> 01:13:26,503
Heads, I go through with it.

869
01:13:27,181 --> 01:13:31,116
This is your life! You can't leave
something like that to chance.

870
01:13:31,662 --> 01:13:32,617
I'm not.

871
01:13:35,724 --> 01:13:37,866
You make your own luck.

872
01:14:00,728 --> 01:14:02,440
Hey! You wait like
everyone else, pal.

873
01:14:10,326 --> 01:14:14,484
What the hell is that?
Obstruction ahead! Obstruction ahead!

874
01:14:15,180 --> 01:14:18,933
Damn it! All units, divert down onto
lower 5th. I repeat, exit down.

875
01:14:18,933 --> 01:14:22,682
- Exit down!
- Lower 5th? We'll be like
turkeys on Thanksgiving down there.

876
01:14:56,004 --> 01:14:57,543
Come on. Get us out of here.
Let's go

877
01:14:59,663 --> 01:15:01,951
Listen, we need backup.
We've got company.

878
01:15:01,951 --> 01:15:03,126
We got trouble, guys.

879
01:15:06,392 --> 01:15:07,353
Lock and load!

880
01:15:18,648 --> 01:15:19,932
What the hell was that?

881
01:15:42,112 --> 01:15:43,616
These things were
built for that, right?

882
01:15:43,617 --> 01:15:45,676
He's going to need something
a lot bigger to get through this.

883
01:15:47,837 --> 01:15:48,472
What is that?

884
01:15:50,343 --> 01:15:51,624
What is that? A bazooka!

885
01:16:00,297 --> 01:16:01,589
I didn't sign up for this!

886
01:16:18,387 --> 01:16:19,132
Look out.

887
01:16:20,490 --> 01:16:21,044
Down!

888
01:16:44,198 --> 01:16:45,367
Come on! Let's go!

889
01:17:31,796 --> 01:17:37,168
Harvey, Harvey, Harvey Dent!
Excuse me, I want to drive.

890
01:17:41,771 --> 01:17:45,151
Scanning all systems.
Scanning all systems.

891
01:17:52,794 --> 01:17:55,210
We got to get topside.
We need air support now.

892
01:18:00,585 --> 01:18:02,573
I like this job! I like it!

893
01:18:04,621 --> 01:18:07,760
Damage catastrophic.
Eject sequence initiated.

894
01:18:21,317 --> 01:18:22,048
Goodbye.

895
01:18:32,074 --> 01:18:34,302
We're on point! Ready to give them
some of their own medicine.

896
01:18:41,512 --> 01:18:43,785
That's what I'm talking about.
Aircabs.

897
01:18:57,639 --> 01:19:00,873
Okay! Rack 'em up, rack 'em up,
rack 'em up!

898
01:19:27,586 --> 01:19:28,496
That's not good.

899
01:19:32,329 --> 01:19:33,516
Okay, That's not good!

900
01:20:16,280 --> 01:20:18,236
Now there is the Batman.

901
01:20:22,802 --> 01:20:24,444
Oh, you want to play!
Come on.

902
01:20:27,286 --> 01:20:27,815
Come on ...

903
01:20:37,391 --> 01:20:38,012
He missed!

904
01:20:52,480 --> 01:20:54,450
You can't stop here!
We're like sitting ducks!

905
01:21:16,383 --> 01:21:19,659
Come on ... Come on ...
I want you to do it.

906
01:21:19,659 --> 01:21:20,660
Come on!

907
01:21:27,533 --> 01:21:29,927
Hit me ... hit me!

908
01:21:31,483 --> 01:21:32,394
Hit me!

909
01:22:00,949 --> 01:22:02,694
Could you please just give me a minute?

910
01:22:05,171 --> 01:22:06,973
We got you,
you son of a bitch.

911
01:22:10,490 --> 01:22:14,945
Gordon ... You do like to
play things pretty close to the chest?

912
01:22:14,946 --> 01:22:15,946
We got him, Harvey.

913
01:22:17,038 --> 01:22:19,905
Mr. Dent, Mr. Dent! How does it feel
to be the biggest hero in Gotham?

914
01:22:19,905 --> 01:22:23,889
No. I'm no hero.
Gotham's finest, they're the heroes.

915
01:22:23,889 --> 01:22:26,587
But you and your office have been
working with the Batman all along?

916
01:22:27,087 --> 01:22:31,133
No. But I trusted him to do
the right thing. Saving my ass.

917
01:22:31,134 --> 01:22:33,976
Alright people! That's enough.
Let him be.

918
01:22:33,976 --> 01:22:38,757
Thank you, detective. I got a date
with a pretty upset girlfriend.

919
01:22:38,757 --> 01:22:40,068
Thank you, counselor.

920
01:22:56,675 --> 01:22:59,197
Stay away! All of you.

921
01:23:00,414 --> 01:23:03,843
I don't want anything for his mob lawyer
to use, you understand?

922
01:23:05,801 --> 01:23:06,963
Back from the dead?

923
01:23:09,440 --> 01:23:12,377
I. .. I couldn't risk my
family's safety.

924
01:23:13,564 --> 01:23:14,450
What do we got?

925
01:23:16,845 --> 01:23:22,867
Nothing. No matches on prints, DNA, dental.
Clothing is custom, no labels.

926
01:23:22,868 --> 01:23:29,570
Nothing in his pockets but knives and lint.
No name, no other alias.

927
01:23:29,569 --> 01:23:34,919
Go home, Gordon. The clown will keep til morning.
Go get some rest. You're going to need it.

928
01:23:35,853 --> 01:23:41,797
Tomorrow you take the big job. You don't have
any say in the matter, Commissioner Gordon.

929
01:23:58,113 --> 01:23:59,836
I'm sorry, I couldn't risk ...

930
01:24:07,326 --> 01:24:09,662
- Heads up big bastards!
- I don't feel good...

931
01:24:09,662 --> 01:24:10,520
You're a cop killer.

932
01:24:10,521 --> 01:24:12,734
You're lucky to be feeling
anything below the neck.

933
01:24:12,735 --> 01:24:13,736
Police!

934
01:24:13,737 --> 01:24:14,738
Stay away from the bars!

935
01:24:14,739 --> 01:24:15,740
My insides hurt.

936
01:24:30,858 --> 01:24:32,805
Did Batman save you, Daddy?

937
01:24:34,985 --> 01:24:38,905
Actually this time I saved him.

938
01:24:50,960 --> 01:24:52,304
Has he said anything yet?

939
01:24:59,701 --> 01:25:03,212
Evening ... Commissioner.

940
01:25:11,622 --> 01:25:13,200
Harvey Dent never made it home.

941
01:25:14,164 --> 01:25:14,927
Of course not.

942
01:25:14,928 --> 01:25:16,217
What have you done with him?

943
01:25:17,252 --> 01:25:21,825
Me? I was right here.

944
01:25:23,971 --> 01:25:25,447
Who did you leave him with?

945
01:25:26,628 --> 01:25:27,828
Your people?

946
01:25:29,693 --> 01:25:35,039
That's assuming of course that they
are still your people, and not Maroni's.

947
01:25:38,245 --> 01:25:40,324
Does it depress you, commissioner?

948
01:25:41,084 --> 01:25:45,967
To know just how alone you really are?

949
01:25:48,245 --> 01:25:52,901
Does it make you feel responsible
for Harvey Dent's current predicament?

950
01:25:52,901 --> 01:25:53,902
Where is he?

951
01:25:54,897 --> 01:25:55,935
What's the time?

952
01:25:56,554 --> 01:25:57,920
What difference does that make?

953
01:25:57,920 --> 01:26:03,083
Well, depending on the time,
he may in one spot or several.

954
01:26:09,751 --> 01:26:17,619
If we're gonna play games...
I'm gonna need a cup of coffee.

955
01:26:18,080 --> 01:26:21,807
Ah, the good cop, bad cop routine?

956
01:26:23,054 --> 01:26:24,228
Not exactly.

957
01:26:34,167 --> 01:26:38,415
Never start with the head, the victim
gets all fuzzy.  He can't feel ...

958
01:26:41,491 --> 01:26:42,719
See?

959
01:26:42,719 --> 01:26:45,223
You wanted me. Here I am.

960
01:26:46,513 --> 01:26:50,867
I wanted to see what you would do.
And you didn't disappoint.

961
01:26:51,700 --> 01:26:53,972
You let five people die.

962
01:26:55,701 --> 01:26:58,852
Then you let
Dent take your place.

963
01:26:59,330 --> 01:27:01,970
- Even to a guy like me, that's cold.
- Where's Dent?

964
01:27:01,971 --> 01:27:06,031
Those mob fools want you gone
so they can get back to the way things were.

965
01:27:07,360 --> 01:27:10,482
But I know the truth.
There's no going back.

966
01:27:10,482 --> 01:27:13,179
You've changed things ... Forever.

967
01:27:13,179 --> 01:27:14,846
Then why do you want to kill me?

968
01:27:17,281 --> 01:27:21,041
I don't want to kill you!
What would I do without you?

969
01:27:21,042 --> 01:27:29,251
Go back to ripping off mob dealers?
No, no. No! You .. complete me.

970
01:27:29,250 --> 01:27:31,445
You're garbage. You kill for money.

971
01:27:31,445 --> 01:27:33,462
Don't talk like
one of them. You're not!

972
01:27:33,463 --> 01:27:41,239
Even if you'd like to be. To them you're
just a freak. Like me.

973
01:27:41,758 --> 01:27:43,201
They need you right now.

974
01:27:44,768 --> 01:27:50,338
When they don't,
they'll cast you out.

975
01:27:50,338 --> 01:27:56,424
See there are morals, your code ...
it's a bad joke.

976
01:27:57,294 --> 01:27:59,454
Dropped at the first
sign of trouble.

977
01:28:01,428 --> 01:28:03,885
They are only as good as
the world allows them to be.

978
01:28:04,570 --> 01:28:06,488
I'll show you. When the chips are down

979
01:28:07,696 --> 01:28:12,610
these civilized people,
they'll eat each other.

980
01:28:13,834 --> 01:28:19,218
See, I'm not a monster.
I'm just ahead of the curve.

981
01:28:21,084 --> 01:28:22,131
Where's Dent?

982
01:28:22,131 --> 01:28:24,944
You have all these rules
and you think they'll save you.

983
01:28:28,568 --> 01:28:29,403
He's in control.

984
01:28:29,642 --> 01:28:30,808
I have one rule.

985
01:28:30,809 --> 01:28:34,273
Oh .. Then that's the rule you'll
have to break to know the truth. .

986
01:28:34,273 --> 01:28:35,274
Which is?

987
01:28:35,274 --> 01:28:38,398
The only sensible way to live
in this world is without rules.

988
01:28:38,399 --> 01:28:40,968
And tonight you're gonna break
your one rule.

989
01:28:41,250 --> 01:28:42,214
I'm considering it.

990
01:28:42,214 --> 01:28:46,635
No, there's only minutes left, so you're gonna have to
play my little game if you want to save one of them.

991
01:28:49,528 --> 01:28:55,739
You know for a while there I thought you  really
were Dent. The way you threw yourself after her ...

992
01:29:02,981 --> 01:29:03,866
Look at you go?

993
01:29:09,322 --> 01:29:12,299
Does Harvey know about
you and his little bunny?

994
01:29:13,960 --> 01:29:15,313
Where are they?

995
01:29:15,314 --> 01:29:17,161
Killing is making a choice.

996
01:29:17,863 --> 01:29:18,998
Where are they?

997
01:29:18,999 --> 01:29:24,740
Choose between one life or the other.
Your friend, the DA, or his blushing bride-to-be?

998
01:29:30,744 --> 01:29:38,091
You have nothing to threaten me with.
Nothing to do with all your strength.

999
01:29:39,249 --> 01:29:41,127
Don't worry.
I'm gonna tell you where they are.

1000
01:29:41,127 --> 01:29:46,322
Both of them. And that's the point.
You'll have to choose.

1001
01:29:46,322 --> 01:29:53,372
He's at 250 52nd street.
And she's on Avenue X, at Cicero.

1002
01:29:55,074 --> 01:29:56,864
- Which one you going after?
- Rachel.

1003
01:29:58,293 --> 01:29:59,361
We're getting Dent!

1004
01:30:01,886 --> 01:30:03,704
250 52nd street!

1005
01:30:07,585 --> 01:30:12,067
Hello! Can anybody hear me?

1006
01:30:15,059 --> 01:30:16,974
Hello!

1007
01:30:21,827 --> 01:30:23,607
- Rachel?
- Harvey!

1008
01:30:23,608 --> 01:30:26,743
Oh, Harvey! Thank God!
Are you okay?

1009
01:30:26,743 --> 01:30:32,033
I'm alright. I'm in a warehouse.
They've got me wired to these oil drums.

1010
01:30:32,818 --> 01:30:35,305
I am too.
Harvey ...

1011
01:30:43,807 --> 01:30:47,815
I want...I want my phone call.
I want my phone call!

1012
01:30:47,816 --> 01:30:48,816
I want my phone call.

1013
01:30:49,864 --> 01:30:50,862
That's nice.

1014
01:30:53,096 --> 01:30:57,287
How many of your friends have I killed?

1015
01:31:01,589 --> 01:31:02,869
I'm a twenty year man.

1016
01:31:02,870 --> 01:31:06,248
I know the difference between punks
who need a little lesson in manners...

1017
01:31:06,248 --> 01:31:08,701
and the freaks like you
who just enjoy it.

1018
01:31:10,378 --> 01:31:12,485
And you've killed six of my friends.

1019
01:31:14,375 --> 01:31:16,738
Please. My insides hurt.

1020
01:31:16,738 --> 01:31:18,311
I don't really care! Back away.

1021
01:31:18,346 --> 01:31:21,076
The boss said that
he'd make the voices go away.

1022
01:31:21,881 --> 01:31:24,648
He said he'd go inside and
replace them with bright lights.

1023
01:31:25,501 --> 01:31:26,772
Like Christmas!

1024
01:31:26,772 --> 01:31:28,730
You're out of your mind, pal. Back off!

1025
01:31:29,293 --> 01:31:31,899
Medic right away in the holding
deck. Come on, get the door open.

1026
01:31:32,870 --> 01:31:34,099
You guys back off!

1027
01:31:34,099 --> 01:31:40,449
Listen, we don't have a lot of time. He told me
that only one of us was going to make it.

1028
01:31:40,449 --> 01:31:42,664
And that they were
going to let our friends choose.

1029
01:31:46,471 --> 01:31:52,503
Okay, Rachel. It's going to be fine. It going
to be all right. They're coming for you.

1030
01:31:52,502 --> 01:31:56,631
Okay. I'll help you. Talk me through
with what's going on with you.

1031
01:31:57,259 --> 01:31:59,174
Can find anything sharp?

1032
01:31:59,525 --> 01:32:00,431
I'm trying.

1033
01:32:00,908 --> 01:32:03,880
What...Harvey?

1034
01:32:08,388 --> 01:32:09,600
Harvey, what's happening?

1035
01:32:19,628 --> 01:32:23,314
All available units.
Converge to 250 52nd street.

1036
01:32:23,703 --> 01:32:27,858
Do you want to know
why I use a knife?

1037
01:32:29,952 --> 01:32:37,657
Guns are too quick. You can't
savor all the little emotion.

1038
01:32:39,743 --> 01:32:47,270
You see... In their last moments
people show you who they really are.

1039
01:32:48,500 --> 01:32:53,619
So, in a way I know your
friends better than you ever did.

1040
01:32:58,084 --> 01:33:00,508
Would you like to know
which of them were cowards?

1041
01:33:08,083 --> 01:33:13,193
- What's that?
- He's got some kind of a contusion.

1042
01:33:13,192 --> 01:33:19,579
I know you're going to enjoy this.
I'm gonna have to try and enjoy it even more.

1043
01:33:29,079 --> 01:33:30,472
Easy! Easy!

1044
01:33:30,472 --> 01:33:36,623
Drop the weapon now! Let him go now!
Drop the weapon!

1045
01:33:36,623 --> 01:33:38,802
- Sorry.
- What do you want?

1046
01:33:40,353 --> 01:33:42,022
I just want my phone call.

1047
01:33:45,390 --> 01:33:47,337
What ... What's happening?

1048
01:33:48,514 --> 01:33:50,329
Just talk to me
for one second.

1049
01:33:53,565 --> 01:33:54,290
Alright.

1050
01:34:08,115 --> 01:34:09,889
Is that a ... phone?

1051
01:34:19,902 --> 01:34:20,972
Mount the curb!

1052
01:34:29,083 --> 01:34:33,141
Harvey ... just in case,
I want to tell you something.

1053
01:34:33,141 --> 01:34:34,962
Don't think like that, Rachel!
They're coming for you.

1054
01:34:34,962 --> 01:34:37,259
I know they are.
But I don't want them to.

1055
01:34:41,748 --> 01:34:44,972
I don't want to live without you and
I do have an answer for you.

1056
01:34:46,096 --> 01:34:47,815
My answer is yes.

1057
01:34:50,633 --> 01:34:57,553
No! No! No! Not me. Why
are you coming for me? No!

1058
01:34:59,088 --> 01:35:00,831
Rachel! Rachel!

1059
01:35:01,068 --> 01:35:04,425
Harvey ... Okay.

1060
01:35:07,832 --> 01:35:12,744
Harvey, it's okay. It's alright.
Listen. Some ...

1061
01:35:19,315 --> 01:35:20,451
No!

1062
01:35:20,759 --> 01:35:23,095
Rachel! No!

1063
01:35:38,004 --> 01:35:39,012
Hello there.

1064
01:35:45,000 --> 01:35:47,476
Back at the MCU
the Joker's gone.

1065
01:35:49,252 --> 01:35:50,237
With Lau?

1066
01:35:53,529 --> 01:35:59,090
The Joker planned to be caught.
He wanted me to lock him up in the MCU.

1067
01:36:18,388 --> 01:36:19,343
Dear Bruce.

1068
01:36:22,103 --> 01:36:24,218
I need to be honest and clear.

1069
01:36:26,951 --> 01:36:28,661
I'm going to marry Harvey Dent.

1070
01:36:29,713 --> 01:36:33,042
I love him and I want to spend
the rest of my life with him.

1071
01:36:34,110 --> 01:36:36,105
When I told you that if
Gotham not longer needed

1072
01:36:36,105 --> 01:36:39,676
Batman we could be
together, I meant it.

1073
01:36:41,105 --> 01:36:45,757
But now I'm sure the day won't come when
you no longer need Batman.

1074
01:36:46,872 --> 01:36:53,919
I hope it does. And if it does,
I'll be there. But as your friend.

1075
01:36:54,581 --> 01:36:55,965
I'm sorry, Harvey.

1076
01:36:56,999 --> 01:36:58,515
I'm sorry I let you down.

1077
01:36:59,267 --> 01:37:03,399
If you lose your faith in me,
please keep your faith in people.

1078
01:37:05,120 --> 01:37:08,689
Love, now and always,
Rachel.

1079
01:37:17,441 --> 01:37:19,048
I prepared a little breakfast.

1080
01:37:23,674 --> 01:37:24,780
Very well, then ...

1081
01:37:24,815 --> 01:37:26,046
Alfred.

1082
01:37:26,046 --> 01:37:27,047
Yes, Master Wayne.

1083
01:37:28,273 --> 01:37:29,892
Should I bring this on her?

1084
01:37:31,663 --> 01:37:36,816
I was meant to inspire good.
Not madness, not death.

1085
01:37:36,816 --> 01:37:41,372
You have inspired good. But you spat
in the faces of Gotham's criminals.

1086
01:37:41,372 --> 01:37:46,307
Didn't you think there might be some casualties? Things
are always going to get worse before they get better.

1087
01:37:46,306 --> 01:37:47,865
But Rachel, Alfred ...

1088
01:37:47,866 --> 01:37:53,543
Rachel believed in what you
stood for. What we stand for.

1089
01:37:53,543 --> 01:37:55,594
Gotham needs you.

1090
01:37:56,137 --> 01:37:58,230
No. Gotham needs
its true hero.

1091
01:37:59,667 --> 01:38:03,772
And I let that murdering psychopathic
blow him half to hell.

1092
01:38:03,771 --> 01:38:08,782
Which is why for now they're
going to have to make do with you.

1093
01:38:11,069 --> 01:38:13,086
She was going to wait for me, Alfred.

1094
01:38:14,776 --> 01:38:18,285
Dent doesn't know.
He can never know.

1095
01:38:20,922 --> 01:38:23,686
- What's that?
- It could wait.

1096
01:38:24,314 --> 01:38:29,566
That bandit in the forest,
in Burma. Did you catch him?

1097
01:38:29,567 --> 01:38:30,568
Yes

1098
01:38:30,569 --> 01:38:31,570
How?

1099
01:38:33,499 --> 01:38:34,998
We burned the forest down.

1100
01:39:14,109 --> 01:39:17,107
He's a credible source.
An MNA lawyer from a prestigious consultancy.

1101
01:39:17,107 --> 01:39:20,142
He says he's waited as long as he can
for the Batman to do the right thing.

1102
01:39:20,694 --> 01:39:22,570
Now he's taking matters
into his own hands.

1103
01:39:23,049 --> 01:39:25,390
We'll be live at 5 with the
true identity of the Batman.

1104
01:39:42,254 --> 01:39:44,101
I'm sorry about Rachel.

1105
01:39:46,781 --> 01:39:50,654
The doctor says you're in agonizing pain,
but you won't accept medication.

1106
01:39:52,553 --> 01:39:56,288
That you're refusing
to accept skin grafts.

1107
01:39:56,288 --> 01:40:04,227
You remember that name you all had for
me when I was at Internal Affairs?

1108
01:40:07,645 --> 01:40:08,795
What was it, Gordon?

1109
01:40:09,306 --> 01:40:10,383
Harvey ...

1110
01:40:10,961 --> 01:40:11,866
Say it.

1111
01:40:13,912 --> 01:40:15,084
Say it!

1112
01:40:23,655 --> 01:40:25,986
Two Face ... Harvey Two Face.

1113
01:40:28,178 --> 01:40:32,115
Why should I hide who I am?

1114
01:40:33,967 --> 01:40:35,552
I know you tried to warn me.

1115
01:40:36,138 --> 01:40:36,994
I'm sorry.

1116
01:40:38,187 --> 01:40:40,844
Wuertz picked you up.
Was he working for them?

1117
01:40:43,062 --> 01:40:45,264
Do you know who picked up Rachel?

1118
01:40:46,034 --> 01:40:49,166
Harvey, I need to know which
of my men I can trust.

1119
01:40:49,166 --> 01:40:51,390
Why would you listen to me now?

1120
01:40:52,756 --> 01:40:54,234
I'm sorry, Harvey.

1121
01:40:56,824 --> 01:41:03,222
No, no, you're not.
Not yet.

1122
01:41:09,151 --> 01:41:11,352
He's crazy. It's too much...

1123
01:41:11,353 --> 01:41:14,797
You should have thought about that
before you let the clown out of the box.

1124
01:41:15,279 --> 01:41:15,867
You want him?

1125
01:41:19,362 --> 01:41:21,743
I can tell you where
he'll be this afternoon.

1126
01:41:29,718 --> 01:41:32,038
You're not so crazy as you look.

1127
01:41:32,038 --> 01:41:35,059
I told you I'm a man of my word.

1128
01:41:39,364 --> 01:41:40,516
Where's the Italian?

1129
01:41:40,517 --> 01:41:43,892
All tactical units will converge
on the location in 20 minutes.

1130
01:41:43,892 --> 01:41:47,429
I want auxiliary units to cover
all possible getaway routes.

1131
01:41:48,193 --> 01:41:52,803
Joker,
What do you do with all your money?

1132
01:41:53,354 --> 01:42:03,258
I'm a guy of simple taste. I enjoy
dynamite, gunpowder and gasoline!

1133
01:42:05,475 --> 01:42:06,165
But what ...?

1134
01:42:09,671 --> 01:42:13,886
And you know the thing that they
have in common? They're cheap.

1135
01:42:14,303 --> 01:42:17,031
I want to know how much they're
paying you to say who Batman really is.

1136
01:42:17,031 --> 01:42:20,986
This is our chance. I want
Lau alive. The Joker ... either way.

1137
01:42:21,410 --> 01:42:22,730
Hey, Jim! Get a load of this.

1138
01:42:22,731 --> 01:42:23,731
Let's take the next caller.

1139
01:42:24,466 --> 01:42:26,129
Harvey Dent didn't want to give
in to this maniac.

1140
01:42:26,130 --> 01:42:27,380
Do you think you know better than him?

1141
01:42:27,979 --> 01:42:31,866
I think that if we could talk to Dent
today he may feel differently.

1142
01:42:31,866 --> 01:42:35,928
And we wish him a speedy recovery.
God knows we need him now.

1143
01:42:35,928 --> 01:42:38,221
You said you were a man of your word.

1144
01:42:38,221 --> 01:42:43,580
Oh, I am! I'm only
burning my half.

1145
01:42:46,357 --> 01:42:48,202
All you care about is money.

1146
01:42:48,642 --> 01:42:51,488
This town deserves a
better class of criminals.

1147
01:42:52,004 --> 01:42:53,484
and I'm gonna give it to them.

1148
01:42:55,318 --> 01:42:57,654
Tell your men
they work for me now.

1149
01:42:57,654 --> 01:42:59,512
This is my city.

1150
01:43:00,943 --> 01:43:03,698
They won't work
for a freak.

1151
01:43:03,699 --> 01:43:07,591
A freak? Why don't we cut
you up into little pieces

1152
01:43:07,591 --> 01:43:13,887
and feed you to your pooches? Hmm?
And then we'll see how loyal a hungry dog really is.

1153
01:43:15,044 --> 01:43:22,834
It's not about money. It's about
sending a message: Everything burns.

1154
01:43:26,280 --> 01:43:28,220
- Who is this?
- I had a vision.

1155
01:43:28,221 --> 01:43:34,115
A world without Batman.
The mob ground out a little profit.

1156
01:43:34,114 --> 01:43:37,675
The police tried to shut them down
one block at a time.

1157
01:43:37,676 --> 01:43:42,854
And it was so ... boring.
I've had a change of heart.

1158
01:43:42,853 --> 01:43:46,547
I don't want Mr. Reese
spoiling everything.

1159
01:43:46,547 --> 01:43:48,724
But why should I have all the fun?

1160
01:43:48,725 --> 01:43:51,100
Let's give someone else a chance.

1161
01:43:51,100 --> 01:43:58,209
If Coleman Reese isn't dead in
60 minutes then I blow up a hospital.

1162
01:43:58,209 --> 01:44:01,910
I want you to call in every officer.
Tell them to head to their nearest hospital.

1163
01:44:01,910 --> 01:44:03,509
And start evac and search.

1164
01:44:03,509 --> 01:44:05,585
Call the transport authority,
school board, prisons.

1165
01:44:05,586 --> 01:44:07,438
Get every available bystander
to a hospital.

1166
01:44:07,438 --> 01:44:12,325
The priority is Gotham General.
Wheel everybody out of that place now!

1167
01:44:12,326 --> 01:44:13,946
You, you and you. Come with me.

1168
01:44:13,946 --> 01:44:14,947
Where are we going, Sir?

1169
01:44:14,948 --> 01:44:15,982
To get Reese.

1170
01:44:16,319 --> 01:44:19,499
I need you plugged in checking
Gordon's men and their families.

1171
01:44:19,974 --> 01:44:20,649
Looking for?

1172
01:44:20,650 --> 01:44:21,933
Hospital admissions.

1173
01:44:21,934 --> 01:44:23,941
Will you be wanting the Batpod, sir?

1174
01:44:23,941 --> 01:44:25,987
In the middle of the day, Alfred?
Not very subtle.

1175
01:44:25,988 --> 01:44:29,599
The Lamborghini, then?
Much more subtle ...

1176
01:44:43,557 --> 01:44:45,483
Excuse me. Let me through.
Excuse me.

1177
01:44:46,079 --> 01:44:48,803
Sir, could you help, please?

1178
01:44:49,857 --> 01:44:51,162
Go find a bus for him.

1179
01:44:53,298 --> 01:44:57,179
Sir, commissioner. Do you really think an
ordinary citizen will try to kill this man?

1180
01:45:18,279 --> 01:45:20,383
See Brian Richards.

1181
01:45:20,932 --> 01:45:24,333
No immediate family member
admitted to a Gotham hospital.

1182
01:45:25,706 --> 01:45:28,145
- They're trying to kill me.
- Maybe the Batman can save you.

1183
01:45:42,383 --> 01:45:44,083
Davis, I got space.
Bring him out.

1184
01:45:46,716 --> 01:45:47,494
Davis!

1185
01:45:53,788 --> 01:45:55,662
I saw Burns and there's Zachary.

1186
01:45:56,278 --> 01:45:57,426
Nothing on them.

1187
01:45:57,427 --> 01:45:58,946
And a patrolman I don't know.

1188
01:46:00,431 --> 01:46:01,789
So what now ...

1189
01:46:03,615 --> 01:46:04,788
Where are we going?

1190
01:46:07,961 --> 01:46:09,452
Send the information to Gordon.

1191
01:46:17,491 --> 01:46:18,752
Get out of here.

1192
01:46:21,226 --> 01:46:22,027
Davis!

1193
01:46:26,115 --> 01:46:27,540
Ma'am, we're going to
have to move him now ...

1194
01:46:40,209 --> 01:46:41,639
It's Berg, isn't it?

1195
01:46:41,640 --> 01:46:42,641
Commissioner.

1196
01:46:43,745 --> 01:46:44,976
You okay, son?

1197
01:47:01,730 --> 01:47:03,051
Hi.

1198
01:47:08,001 --> 01:47:09,157
You know.

1199
01:47:10,241 --> 01:47:13,460
I don't want there to be
any hard feelings between us, Harvey.

1200
01:47:13,920 --> 01:47:15,756
When you and uh ..

1201
01:47:15,790 --> 01:47:16,892
Rachel!

1202
01:47:16,893 --> 01:47:21,684
... Rachel were being abducted I was
sitting in Gordon's cage.

1203
01:47:22,881 --> 01:47:24,934
I didn't rig those charges.

1204
01:47:24,934 --> 01:47:26,853
Your men, your plan.

1205
01:47:27,599 --> 01:47:29,751
Do I really look like a
guy with a plan?

1206
01:47:30,443 --> 01:47:33,601
You know what I am? I'm a dog
chasing cars.

1207
01:47:33,601 --> 01:47:36,144
I wouldn't know what to do
with one if I caught it!

1208
01:47:36,593 --> 01:47:39,135
You know, I just do things.

1209
01:47:39,943 --> 01:47:43,796
The mob has plans,
the cops have plans.

1210
01:47:43,796 --> 01:47:48,563
Gordon's got plans.
They're schemers.

1211
01:47:49,251 --> 01:47:52,534
Schemers trying to control
their little worlds.

1212
01:47:53,414 --> 01:47:58,990
I'm not a schemer. I try to show
the schemers how pathetic

1213
01:47:58,989 --> 01:48:02,082
their attempts to control
things really are.

1214
01:48:03,003 --> 01:48:05,494
So ... When I say ...

1215
01:48:05,495 --> 01:48:06,495
Come here.

1216
01:48:06,495 --> 01:48:10,216
When I say that you and your
girlfriend was nothing personal ...

1217
01:48:11,891 --> 01:48:13,529
You know that I'm telling the truth.

1218
01:48:16,569 --> 01:48:17,907
I'm going to need your weapon.

1219
01:48:18,591 --> 01:48:19,198
What?

1220
01:48:22,926 --> 01:48:24,805
Why? Because my
wife is in the hospital?

1221
01:48:25,498 --> 01:48:26,907
Yeah. That would be why.

1222
01:48:27,886 --> 01:48:31,335
It's the schemers that
put you where you are.

1223
01:48:31,335 --> 01:48:37,494
You were a schemer. You had
plans. And look where that got you.

1224
01:48:48,492 --> 01:48:50,712
The police force are taking every
possible precaution

1225
01:48:50,712 --> 01:48:52,906
urging everyone not to take matters
into their own hands.

1226
01:48:53,227 --> 01:48:59,345
I just did what I do best. I took your
little plan and I turned it on itself.

1227
01:48:59,344 --> 01:49:01,503
Look what I did to
this city with a few

1228
01:49:01,504 --> 01:49:04,469
drums of gas
and a couple of bullets.

1229
01:49:06,648 --> 01:49:08,344
You know ... You know what I noticed?

1230
01:49:08,344 --> 01:49:11,251
Nobody panics when things
go according to plan.

1231
01:49:12,395 --> 01:49:14,196
Even if the plan is horrifying.

1232
01:49:14,196 --> 01:49:19,442
If tomorrow I tell the press that
like a gangbanger will get shot

1233
01:49:19,443 --> 01:49:24,950
or a truckload of soldiers will be
blown up, nobody panics.

1234
01:49:25,504 --> 01:49:28,474
Because it's all part of the plan.

1235
01:49:28,700 --> 01:49:32,832
But when I say that
one little old mayor will die ...

1236
01:49:33,616 --> 01:49:35,679
Well then everybody loses their minds!

1237
01:49:39,575 --> 01:49:41,499
Introduce a little anarchy.

1238
01:49:43,816 --> 01:49:49,991
Upset the established order.
And everything becomes chaos.

1239
01:49:52,533 --> 01:49:54,316
I'm an agent of chaos.

1240
01:49:55,691 --> 01:49:57,628
Oh, and you know the thing about chaos?

1241
01:50:00,016 --> 01:50:01,614
It's fair.

1242
01:50:10,981 --> 01:50:12,195
You live ...

1243
01:50:14,654 --> 01:50:15,903
You die ...

1244
01:50:16,946 --> 01:50:18,575
Now we're talking!

1245
01:50:27,839 --> 01:50:28,556
Mr. Reese ...

1246
01:50:47,429 --> 01:50:51,707
It's Mr. Wayne, isn't it?
That was a very brave thing you did.

1247
01:50:51,707 --> 01:50:52,931
Trying to catch the light?

1248
01:50:52,932 --> 01:50:54,730
You weren't protecting the Van?

1249
01:50:54,730 --> 01:50:55,938
Why? Who's in it?

1250
01:51:01,428 --> 01:51:03,566
Do you think I should
go to the hospital?

1251
01:51:03,566 --> 01:51:06,315
You don't watch a whole lot of news,
do you, Mr. Wayne?

1252
01:52:12,296 --> 01:52:18,419
Southeast ... That's Gotham general.
Did you clear the building?

1253
01:52:22,062 --> 01:52:24,755
We must know how many were inside!
You got patient lists, role calls.

1254
01:52:24,755 --> 01:52:27,628
Right now, we're showing
fifty people missing. One bus.

1255
01:52:27,629 --> 01:52:31,162
All these others buses are heading off
to other hospitals. My guess is we missed one.

1256
01:52:31,162 --> 01:52:33,216
Yeah? Well, what's your guess
about where Harvey Dent is?

1257
01:52:33,216 --> 01:52:34,840
Keep looking.
And keep it to yourself.

1258
01:52:34,841 --> 01:52:36,791
Now if anybody asks, we got him out.

1259
01:52:40,274 --> 01:52:41,653
Get the mayor's office on the line.

1260
01:52:43,893 --> 01:52:45,623
We're going to need the national guard.

1261
01:52:45,958 --> 01:52:48,772
Fifty people are missing,
including GCN's own Michael Engel.

1262
01:52:48,772 --> 01:52:52,549
I'm now being told that we're
cutting to a video GCN has just received.

1263
01:52:52,549 --> 01:52:57,347
I'm Michael Engel for Gotham Tonight. What
does it take to make you people want to join in?

1264
01:52:58,382 --> 01:53:03,954
You failed to kill the lawyer. I've got to
get you off the bench and into the game.

1265
01:53:05,180 --> 01:53:09,850
Come night fall this city is mine. And
anyone left here plays by my rules.

1266
01:53:10,163 --> 01:53:13,841
Mr. Fox, security is showing a
break-in at the RND department.

1267
01:53:13,840 --> 01:53:17,601
If you don't want to be
in the game. Get out now.

1268
01:53:19,758 --> 01:53:24,754
But the bridge and tunnel crowd
are sure in for a surprise. HA HA! HA HA!

1269
01:53:59,241 --> 01:54:00,753
Sweet Jesus!

1270
01:54:02,569 --> 01:54:05,664
Shouldn't you be out there?
Doing something?

1271
01:54:06,093 --> 01:54:07,193
It is my day off.

1272
01:54:08,699 --> 01:54:09,601
I got to take a leak.

1273
01:54:10,709 --> 01:54:12,200
Keep an eye out for me.

1274
01:54:18,335 --> 01:54:20,669
Now what? You need
someone to shake it for you?

1275
01:54:20,669 --> 01:54:21,670
Hello

1276
01:54:22,874 --> 01:54:23,591
Dent?

1277
01:54:24,578 --> 01:54:26,800
Jesus ... I thought
you was dead.

1278
01:54:27,039 --> 01:54:28,174
Half.

1279
01:54:34,560 --> 01:54:36,189
Who picked up Rachel, Wuertz?

1280
01:54:36,189 --> 01:54:37,798
Must have been Maroni's men.

1281
01:54:37,799 --> 01:54:38,800
Shut up!

1282
01:54:40,265 --> 01:54:44,420
Are you telling me that you're going to
protect the other traitor in Gordon's unit?

1283
01:54:44,421 --> 01:54:45,422
I don't know! He never told me.

1284
01:54:45,963 --> 01:54:48,570
Listen, Dent. I swear to God I didn't know
what they were going to do with you.

1285
01:54:51,270 --> 01:54:52,007
That's funny.

1286
01:54:54,251 --> 01:54:55,950
Because I don't know what's
going to happen to you either.

1287
01:55:00,926 --> 01:55:02,782
Beautiful, isn't it?

1288
01:55:03,350 --> 01:55:09,003
Beautiful, unethical, dangerous.

1289
01:55:09,003 --> 01:55:12,927
You've turned every cell phone
in Gotham into a microphone.

1290
01:55:12,927 --> 01:55:15,311
And a high-frequency generator receiver.

1291
01:55:15,755 --> 01:55:20,863
You took my sonar concept
and applied it to every phone in the city.

1292
01:55:20,863 --> 01:55:24,557
With half the city feeding you sonar
you can image all of Gotham.

1293
01:55:27,378 --> 01:55:28,854
This is wrong.

1294
01:55:28,855 --> 01:55:30,851
I've got to find this man, Lucius.

1295
01:55:32,880 --> 01:55:34,094
At what cost?

1296
01:55:34,571 --> 01:55:39,555
The database is null-key encrypted.
It can only be accessed by one person.

1297
01:55:40,954 --> 01:55:43,110
This is too much power for one person.

1298
01:55:43,111 --> 01:55:44,642
That's why I
gave it to you.

1299
01:55:45,936 --> 01:55:47,046
Only you can use it.

1300
01:55:47,464 --> 01:55:51,142
Spying on 30 million people isn't
part of my job description.

1301
01:55:53,514 --> 01:55:54,706
This is an audio signal.

1302
01:55:54,706 --> 01:55:59,104
It feeds off within range of any phone
the city you can triangulate its position.

1303
01:55:59,642 --> 01:56:01,540
I'll help you this one time.

1304
01:56:02,865 --> 01:56:04,653
But consider this my resignation.

1305
01:56:04,654 --> 01:56:08,825
As long as this machine is at
Wayne Enterprises, I won't be.

1306
01:56:10,409 --> 01:56:14,288
When you finish,
type in your name.

1307
01:56:22,707 --> 01:56:25,871
My office is looking over every
inch of the tunnels and bridges,

1308
01:56:25,872 --> 01:56:28,791
but with the Joker's threat
there are limited options.

1309
01:56:28,791 --> 01:56:30,158
And land routes east?

1310
01:56:30,660 --> 01:56:31,564
Backed up for hours.

1311
01:56:32,128 --> 01:56:35,403
We'll just release the ferries.
With thirty thousand ready to board.

1312
01:56:35,861 --> 01:56:38,969
Plus I want to use the ferries so I can
get some of those prisoners off the island.

1313
01:56:39,734 --> 01:56:42,436
The men you and Dent put away?
Those aren't people I'm worried about.

1314
01:56:42,437 --> 01:56:44,230
You should be. Whatever
the Joker's planning

1315
01:56:44,231 --> 01:56:46,902
it's a good bet that Harvey's
prisoners might be involved.

1316
01:56:46,902 --> 01:56:48,041
I want to get them out of here.

1317
01:56:50,521 --> 01:56:51,684
So where is Harvey?

1318
01:56:52,143 --> 01:56:53,281
We haven't found him.

1319
01:56:53,812 --> 01:56:54,639
Jesus ...

1320
01:56:59,111 --> 01:57:00,889
How long can you keep this quiet?

1321
01:57:15,388 --> 01:57:17,741
Don't stop for lights, cops, nothing!

1322
01:57:19,156 --> 01:57:20,293
Going to join your wife?

1323
01:57:24,563 --> 01:57:25,533
You love her?

1324
01:57:26,610 --> 01:57:27,192
Yes

1325
01:57:28,111 --> 01:57:30,640
You ever imagine what it would
be like to listen to her die?

1326
01:57:30,640 --> 01:57:37,367
Look take it up with the Joker. He killed
your woman. He made you ... like this.

1327
01:57:37,720 --> 01:57:39,623
The Joker's just a mad dog.

1328
01:57:40,992 --> 01:57:42,890
I want whoever let
him off the leash.

1329
01:57:44,393 --> 01:57:47,940
I took care of Wuertz. Who is your
other man inside Gordon's unit?

1330
01:57:47,940 --> 01:57:50,431
Who picked up Rachel? It must have
been someone she trusted.

1331
01:57:52,001 --> 01:57:55,176
Look, if I tell you
you'll let me go?

1332
01:57:55,512 --> 01:57:57,279
Can't hurt your chances.

1333
01:57:59,801 --> 01:58:02,074
It was Ramirez.

1334
01:58:07,142 --> 01:58:07,688
But you said ...

1335
01:58:07,689 --> 01:58:09,433
I said it couldn't hurt your chances.

1336
01:58:13,848 --> 01:58:15,377
You're a lucky man.

1337
01:58:19,537 --> 01:58:20,806
But he's not.

1338
01:58:20,807 --> 01:58:21,808
Who?

1339
01:58:24,303 --> 01:58:25,649
Your driver.

1340
01:58:40,122 --> 01:58:42,214
Hey, man! We should
be on that boat!

1341
01:58:42,215 --> 01:58:44,488
You want to ride a bus with them?
Be my guest.

1342
01:59:08,225 --> 01:59:09,384
Sir, they've stopped their engines.

1343
01:59:10,182 --> 01:59:11,324
Right. Get on the radio.

1344
01:59:11,325 --> 01:59:14,578
Tell them we'll come back and pick
them up once we dump the scum bags.

1345
01:59:15,020 --> 01:59:16,918
Liberty, this is Spirit. Come in.

1346
01:59:19,690 --> 01:59:20,714
What the heck was that?

1347
01:59:24,752 --> 01:59:28,646
Liberty, come in please. This is Spirit.

1348
01:59:28,646 --> 01:59:31,405
We have the same problem.
We lost both engines.

1349
01:59:32,186 --> 01:59:34,776
Fox. There's something going on
on the ferries.

1350
01:59:36,710 --> 01:59:38,282
Get down to the engine room now

1351
01:59:50,296 --> 01:59:53,997
Captain, we got a hundreds barrels
down there rigged to blow. And this.

1352
02:00:07,039 --> 02:00:09,964
- Oh my God!
- Looks like some kind of detonator.

1353
02:00:09,965 --> 02:00:12,868
Why would they give us the detonator
to our own bomb?

1354
02:00:15,737 --> 02:00:18,758
Tonight you are all going to
be part of a social experiment.

1355
02:00:23,041 --> 02:00:26,734
For the magic of diesel fuel
and ammonium nitrate,

1356
02:00:26,735 --> 02:00:30,755
I am ready right now
to blow you all sky high.

1357
02:00:31,159 --> 02:00:32,499
Liberty, come in. Over.

1358
02:00:35,060 --> 02:00:36,255
It's dead.

1359
02:00:36,255 --> 02:00:40,477
Anyone attempts to get
off their boat, you all die.

1360
02:00:41,088 --> 02:00:42,036
I'm zeroing in.

1361
02:00:42,502 --> 02:00:47,302
Each of you has a remote
to blow off the other boat.

1362
02:00:47,783 --> 02:00:49,327
The voice is on the ferry.

1363
02:00:50,319 --> 02:00:52,098
But it's not the source.

1364
02:00:54,102 --> 02:00:55,122
West!

1365
02:01:02,698 --> 02:01:04,627
- Gordon.
- I have the Joker's location.

1366
02:01:05,043 --> 02:01:05,789
Prewitt Building.

1367
02:01:06,290 --> 02:01:07,713
Put some along
the building offices.

1368
02:01:10,231 --> 02:01:12,678
At midnight I blow you all up.

1369
02:01:13,000 --> 02:01:17,847
If however one of you presses the
button, I'll let that boat live.

1370
02:01:18,395 --> 02:01:23,807
So whose it going to be? Harvey Dent's
most-wanted scum bag collection?

1371
02:01:23,806 --> 02:01:28,961
Or the sweet and innocent civilians?
You choose.

1372
02:01:28,961 --> 02:01:31,946
Oh! And you might want
to decide quickly because...

1373
02:01:31,946 --> 02:01:36,422
the people on the other boat
may not be quite so noble.

1374
02:01:43,226 --> 02:01:44,150
Stay back!

1375
02:01:44,895 --> 02:01:48,612
Well who are you to decide?
We ought to talk this over at least.

1376
02:01:48,612 --> 02:01:52,172
We don't have to die.
Those men had their chance.

1377
02:01:52,911 --> 02:01:55,382
We are not going to talk about this.

1378
02:01:55,382 --> 02:01:56,952
Why aren't we talking about it?

1379
02:01:56,953 --> 02:01:59,903
They're talking over the
same exact thing on the other boat.

1380
02:01:59,903 --> 02:02:00,903
Let's put it to a vote.

1381
02:02:07,427 --> 02:02:08,153
Hello?

1382
02:02:08,154 --> 02:02:09,681
Barbara. It's Anna Ramirez.

1383
02:02:10,155 --> 02:02:13,282
Jim needs you to pack up and
put the kids in the car right away.

1384
02:02:13,282 --> 02:02:15,130
But the unit's outside?

1385
02:02:15,130 --> 02:02:16,892
Those cops can't be trusted.

1386
02:02:16,893 --> 02:02:19,759
Jim needs you away from them
as soon as possible.

1387
02:02:20,099 --> 02:02:23,336
I'll call them off for ten minutes.
And you'll have to move fast.

1388
02:02:23,336 --> 02:02:25,041
Where am I supposed to take them?

1389
02:02:25,042 --> 02:02:29,296
250 52nd street.
Leave as soon as the patrol car pulls out.

1390
02:02:29,296 --> 02:02:30,297
Okay.

1391
02:02:31,030 --> 02:02:31,975
Did she believe you?

1392
02:02:33,041 --> 02:02:34,206
That's because she trusts you.

1393
02:02:35,509 --> 02:02:36,727
Just like Rachel did.

1394
02:02:36,728 --> 02:02:37,729
I didn't know ...

1395
02:02:37,730 --> 02:02:38,731
Didn't know what they were going to do?

1396
02:02:38,731 --> 02:02:41,245
You're the second cop
to say that to me.

1397
02:02:42,106 --> 02:02:44,164
What exactly did you
think they were going to do?

1398
02:02:44,165 --> 02:02:46,964
They got me early on. My mother's
hospital bills ...

1399
02:02:46,964 --> 02:02:47,966
Don't!

1400
02:02:49,377 --> 02:02:50,193
I'm sorry ...

1401
02:02:50,381 --> 02:02:52,192
You live to fight
another day, office.

1402
02:02:56,528 --> 02:02:57,888
We found the missing hospital bus.

1403
02:02:57,889 --> 02:02:59,909
And we have a hostage situation.

1404
02:03:02,277 --> 02:03:07,080
It's a shooting gallery. Why would he
choose a spot with such good windows?

1405
02:03:07,080 --> 02:03:11,067
We have clear shots on five clowns. The
snipers take them out, smash the windows,

1406
02:03:11,067 --> 02:03:13,753
A team repels in,
a team moves in by the stairwells.

1407
02:03:13,753 --> 02:03:15,701
Two, three casualties max.

1408
02:03:16,175 --> 02:03:16,732
Let's do it.

1409
02:03:16,733 --> 02:03:17,893
It's not that simple.

1410
02:03:17,894 --> 02:03:19,446
With the Joker it never is.

1411
02:03:19,446 --> 02:03:23,914
What's simple is that every second we don't take in those
people on the ferries get closer to blowing each other up

1412
02:03:23,914 --> 02:03:24,915
That won't happen.

1413
02:03:25,163 --> 02:03:27,038
Then he'll blow both of them up!

1414
02:03:27,038 --> 02:03:27,943
We don't have time for paper.

1415
02:03:27,944 --> 02:03:31,802
I want everybody to put their
votes on this piece of paper.

1416
02:03:33,819 --> 02:03:37,118
If anyone's got a pen pass it along.

1417
02:03:41,114 --> 02:03:43,401
We need to get the votes in quickly.

1418
02:03:53,166 --> 02:03:54,910
I need five minutes alone.

1419
02:03:54,910 --> 02:03:56,949
No! There's no time!

1420
02:03:56,950 --> 02:04:01,504
We have clear shots! Dent is in there
with them. We have to save Dent.

1421
02:04:01,503 --> 02:04:04,812
I have to save Dent!

1422
02:04:07,754 --> 02:04:10,509
Two minutes. Then we rush.

1423
02:04:15,839 --> 02:04:17,684
Fox, I need picture.

1424
02:04:20,679 --> 02:04:23,111
- Hello?
Jim, we're in trouble!

1425
02:04:24,307 --> 02:04:28,839
Okay. We got POV on alpha.
Unveiling beta.

1426
02:04:31,381 --> 02:04:33,874
It looks like clowns and hostages on 2 floors.

1427
02:04:34,896 --> 02:04:36,584
A SWAT team on stairwell.

1428
02:04:40,483 --> 02:04:42,784
Another SWAT team on the roof.

1429
02:04:47,533 --> 02:04:48,494
Barbara, calm down!

1430
02:04:48,494 --> 02:04:49,953
He has the kids!

1431
02:04:50,254 --> 02:04:51,703
Hello Jim.

1432
02:04:52,689 --> 02:04:55,682
Harvey, where's my family?

1433
02:04:55,682 --> 02:04:57,660
Where my family died.

1434
02:05:00,853 --> 02:05:02,683
Blue Team, acquire the target.

1435
02:05:22,284 --> 02:05:25,705
Fox, the SWAT's targeting the wrong people!
The clowns are the hostages!

1436
02:05:26,817 --> 02:05:29,079
Red Team go!

1437
02:05:37,990 --> 02:05:38,853
Don't move.

1438
02:05:40,215 --> 02:05:41,381
Take the shot!

1439
02:05:47,378 --> 02:05:48,907
Those SWATs are coming in hard.

1440
02:05:48,908 --> 02:05:50,858
Clown, put down your gun!

1441
02:05:54,207 --> 02:05:56,786
Doctors get down, clear the line of fire!

1442
02:06:22,310 --> 02:06:23,383
Freeze!

1443
02:06:31,512 --> 02:06:33,523
You see those bad
guys on the floor above?

1444
02:06:33,824 --> 02:06:37,358
They're waiting for help with the
SWAT team coming up the elevator.

1445
02:06:37,822 --> 02:06:38,996
60 seconds.

1446
02:06:47,356 --> 02:06:51,669
The tally is 140 against,
396 for.

1447
02:06:59,737 --> 02:07:01,936
So go ahead, do it!

1448
02:07:02,336 --> 02:07:03,748
We're still here.

1449
02:07:05,844 --> 02:07:08,214
That means, they haven't
killed us either.

1450
02:07:19,050 --> 02:07:20,631
Trouble on the floor above.

1451
02:07:40,265 --> 02:07:43,267
Freeze!
Or we will shot!

1452
02:07:49,124 --> 02:07:51,124
We got him, he's out of the game.

1453
02:07:52,770 --> 02:07:54,051
Step away from the edge!

1454
02:08:17,733 --> 02:08:18,369
Don't move!

1455
02:08:28,609 --> 02:08:31,277
Ah, you made it!
I'm so thrilled.

1456
02:08:31,277 --> 02:08:33,133
Where's the detonator?

1457
02:08:33,808 --> 02:08:34,837
- Go get him!

1458
02:09:21,889 --> 02:09:25,831
You don't want to die,
but you don't know how to take a life.

1459
02:09:26,723 --> 02:09:33,332
Give it to me. That man
will kill you and take it anyway.

1460
02:09:36,683 --> 02:09:38,536
Noone wants to get their hands dirty.

1461
02:09:39,285 --> 02:09:41,765
Fine, I'll do it.

1462
02:09:43,900 --> 02:09:49,185
Those men on that boat. They made
their choices. They chose to murder and steal.

1463
02:09:49,185 --> 02:09:51,820
It doesn't make any sense
for us to have to die too.

1464
02:10:01,440 --> 02:10:04,129
Oh the old familiar places!

1465
02:10:23,087 --> 02:10:25,020
Hostages are safe.

1466
02:10:26,140 --> 02:10:27,274
Give it to me.

1467
02:10:29,356 --> 02:10:32,591
You can tell I took it by force.

1468
02:10:33,741 --> 02:10:38,894
Give it to me and I'll do what
you should have did 10 minutes ago.

1469
02:11:00,708 --> 02:11:03,912
We really should stop this fighting.
Otherwise, we'll miss the fireworks!

1470
02:11:03,912 --> 02:11:09,810
- There won't be any fireworks.
- And here…we…go!

1471
02:11:48,911 --> 02:11:54,102
What were you trying to prove?
That deep down, everyone's as ugly as you are?

1472
02:11:55,126 --> 02:11:56,605
You're alone!

1473
02:12:02,512 --> 02:12:07,807
You can't rely on anyone these days,
you got to do everything yourself, don't we?

1474
02:12:07,807 --> 02:12:10,841
That's okay. I came prepared.

1475
02:12:11,848 --> 02:12:13,252
It's a funny world that we live in

1476
02:12:13,253 --> 02:12:16,042
speaking of which,
you know how I got these scars?

1477
02:12:16,042 --> 02:12:18,746
No, but I know
how you got these!

1478
02:12:37,233 --> 02:12:43,480
Ugh, you. You just
couldn't let me go, could you?

1479
02:12:43,480 --> 02:12:51,397
This is what happens when an unstoppable
force meets an immovable object.

1480
02:12:52,854 --> 02:12:58,196
You…truly are…incorruptible,
aren't you, huh?

1481
02:12:59,733 --> 02:13:07,158
You won't kill me out of some
misplaced sense of self-righteousness.

1482
02:13:07,869 --> 02:13:14,651
And I won't kill you…
because you're just too much fun!

1483
02:13:15,550 --> 02:13:20,327
I think you and I
are destined to do this forever.

1484
02:13:20,527 --> 02:13:22,499
You'll be in a
padded cell forever.

1485
02:13:22,699 --> 02:13:23,300
Maybe we could share one!

1486
02:13:24,562 --> 02:13:28,864
You know, they'll be doubling up the rate
this city's inhabitants are losing their minds.

1487
02:13:28,863 --> 02:13:36,491
This city just showed you that it's
full of people ready to believe in good.

1488
02:13:36,491 --> 02:13:39,774
Until their spirit breaks completely!

1489
02:13:40,584 --> 02:13:44,359
Until they get a good look
at the real Harvey Dent

1490
02:13:45,375 --> 02:13:48,230
and all the heroic things he's done.

1491
02:13:49,615 --> 02:13:53,527
You didn't think I'd risk losing the battle

1492
02:13:53,527 --> 02:13:57,090
for Gotham's soul
in a fist fight with you?

1493
02:14:00,163 --> 02:14:05,840
No. You need an ace
in the hole. Mine's Harvey.

1494
02:14:05,840 --> 02:14:07,649
What did you do?

1495
02:14:07,650 --> 02:14:14,759
I took Gotham's "White Knight" and I…
brought him down to our level.

1496
02:14:15,246 --> 02:14:21,098
It wasn't hard. You see, madness,
as you know, is like gravity.

1497
02:14:21,485 --> 02:14:24,455
All it takes is a little push!

1498
02:15:03,461 --> 02:15:07,435
This is where they brought her, Gordon…
after your men handed her over.

1499
02:15:08,939 --> 02:15:10,702
This is where she died.

1500
02:15:10,903 --> 02:15:15,021
I know I was here, trying to save her.

1501
02:15:15,496 --> 02:15:16,473
But you didn't.

1502
02:15:17,198 --> 02:15:20,264
- I couldn't.
- Yes, you could have, if you'd listened to me.

1503
02:15:20,364 --> 02:15:22,930
If you stood up against corruption.

1504
02:15:23,301 --> 02:15:25,486
Instead of doing your deal with the devil.

1505
02:15:25,486 --> 02:15:26,487
I was trying to fight the mob!

1506
02:15:27,874 --> 02:15:31,868
You wouldn't dare try to justify
yourself if you knew what I'd loss.

1507
02:15:33,912 --> 02:15:36,824
Have you ever had to talk to the
person you loved most,...

1508
02:15:36,824 --> 02:15:40,049
...tell them it's gonna be alright?
When you know it's not.

1509
02:15:42,686 --> 02:15:46,964
Well, you're about to know
what that feels like, Gordon.

1510
02:15:46,964 --> 02:15:51,969
Then, you can look me in the eye
and tell me you're sorry.

1511
02:15:53,122 --> 02:15:59,061
- You're not going to hurt my family.
- No, just the person you love most.

1512
02:16:07,317 --> 02:16:09,795
So, is it your wife?

1513
02:16:11,876 --> 02:16:15,320
Put the gun down, Harvey.
Harvey put down the gun.

1514
02:16:16,742 --> 02:16:20,013
Please. Please, Harvey.
Please.

1515
02:16:21,331 --> 02:16:24,334
Dammit, will you stop pointing
that gun at my family?

1516
02:16:25,596 --> 02:16:26,567
We have a winner...

1517
02:16:26,576 --> 02:16:29,340
- No Jimmy, stop him!
- Harvey!

1518
02:16:30,398 --> 02:16:34,173
Harvey! I'm sorry...

1519
02:16:36,853 --> 02:16:38,341
...for everything.

1520
02:16:40,255 --> 02:16:42,095
Please don't hurt my son.

1521
02:16:52,862 --> 02:16:54,345
You brought your cops?

1522
02:16:54,746 --> 02:16:56,491
All they know is there's a situation.

1523
02:16:57,520 --> 02:17:00,712
They don't know who or what.
They're just creating a perimeter.

1524
02:17:00,713 --> 02:17:03,044
You think I want to escape from this?

1525
02:17:03,511 --> 02:17:06,340
There is no escape from this.

1526
02:17:06,340 --> 02:17:08,517
You don't wanna hurt the boy, Harvey.

1527
02:17:10,851 --> 02:17:14,146
It's not about what I want,
it's about what's fair!

1528
02:17:14,529 --> 02:17:19,072
You thought we could be decent
man in an indecent time.

1529
02:17:21,832 --> 02:17:23,486
Well, you were wrong.

1530
02:17:23,487 --> 02:17:29,867
The world is cruel and the only
morality in a cruel world is chance.

1531
02:17:30,539 --> 02:17:36,106
Unbiased, unprejudice, fair.

1532
02:17:36,106 --> 02:17:38,598
His son's got the same chance she had.

1533
02:17:39,320 --> 02:17:40,399
50:50.

1534
02:17:40,400 --> 02:17:42,447
What happened to Rachel wasn't chance?

1535
02:17:42,447 --> 02:17:45,519
We decided to act, we three.

1536
02:17:45,920 --> 02:17:49,666
Then, why was it me who was the
only one who lost everything?

1537
02:17:51,646 --> 02:17:52,901
It wasn't.

1538
02:17:52,901 --> 02:17:54,202
The Joker chose me!

1539
02:17:54,794 --> 02:17:56,969
Because you were the best of us.

1540
02:17:57,093 --> 02:18:03,370
He wanted to prove that even
someone as good as you could fall.

1541
02:18:04,314 --> 02:18:05,616
Then, he was right.

1542
02:18:06,017 --> 02:18:07,866
You're the one pointing the gun, Harvey.

1543
02:18:07,867 --> 02:18:11,381
So, point it at the people responsible.

1544
02:18:12,322 --> 02:18:13,518
Fair enough.

1545
02:18:17,116 --> 02:18:18,792
You first.

1546
02:18:31,367 --> 02:18:32,937
My turn.

1547
02:18:40,364 --> 02:18:45,441
Harvey, wait. Rachel's
death was my fault.

1548
02:18:49,470 --> 02:18:51,445
Please don't punish the boy.

1549
02:18:52,472 --> 02:18:53,946
Please punish me.

1550
02:18:57,653 --> 02:18:59,870
Tell your boy it's gonna be alright, Gordon.

1551
02:19:00,156 --> 02:19:03,859
Lie. Like I lied.

1552
02:19:07,330 --> 02:19:09,362
It's going to be alright, son.

1553
02:19:47,429 --> 02:19:50,155
Dad, is he okay?

1554
02:20:06,624 --> 02:20:07,553
Thank you.

1555
02:20:07,554 --> 02:20:08,947
You don't have to thank me.

1556
02:20:09,405 --> 02:20:10,642
Yes, I do.

1557
02:20:15,599 --> 02:20:16,991
The Joker won.

1558
02:20:19,004 --> 02:20:24,192
Harvey's prosecution, everything
he fought for, undone.

1559
02:20:25,065 --> 02:20:27,118
Whatever chance you got
is of fixing our city,...

1560
02:20:27,481 --> 02:20:29,470
...dies with Harvey's reputation.

1561
02:20:30,204 --> 02:20:31,305
We bet it all on him.

1562
02:20:32,583 --> 02:20:35,479
The Joker took the best of us
and tore him down.

1563
02:20:35,479 --> 02:20:36,480
People will lose hope.

1564
02:20:37,624 --> 02:20:38,725
They won't.

1565
02:20:41,722 --> 02:20:43,929
They must never know what he did.

1566
02:20:44,029 --> 02:20:47,729
Five dead, two of them cops?

1567
02:20:47,729 --> 02:20:48,730
You can't sweep that out.

1568
02:20:54,703 --> 02:20:56,967
But The Joker cannot win.

1569
02:21:02,957 --> 02:21:05,802
Gotham needs its true hero.

1570
02:21:12,418 --> 02:21:15,294
- No.
- You either die a hero,...

1571
02:21:15,295 --> 02:21:19,569
...or you live long enough to see
yourself become the villain.

1572
02:21:20,254 --> 02:21:25,879
I could do those things because
I'm not a hero, unlike Dean.

1573
02:21:28,494 --> 02:21:31,663
I killed those people,
that's what I could be.

1574
02:21:31,664 --> 02:21:33,615
No, no you can't!
You're not!

1575
02:21:33,616 --> 02:21:35,453
Of whatever Gotham needs me to be.

1576
02:21:37,967 --> 02:21:39,038
Call it in.

1577
02:21:42,469 --> 02:21:47,573
A hero. Not the hero we deserved,
but the hero we needed.

1578
02:21:47,774 --> 02:21:52,149
Nothing less than a knight, shining.

1579
02:21:53,134 --> 02:21:59,014
- They'll hunt you.
- You'll hunt me. You'll condemn me.

1580
02:22:00,282 --> 02:22:08,428
Set the dogs on me. Because
that's what needs to happen.

1581
02:22:10,089 --> 02:22:13,668
Because sometimes, truth isn't good enough.

1582
02:22:14,994 --> 02:22:16,825
Sometimes people deserve more.

1583
02:22:20,570 --> 02:22:24,674
Sometimes, people deserve to have
their faith rewarded.

1584
02:22:42,914 --> 02:22:47,869
Batman!
Batman!

1585
02:22:48,918 --> 02:22:51,016
Why's he running, dad?

1586
02:22:52,469 --> 02:22:53,966
Because we have to chase him.

1587
02:22:53,966 --> 02:22:56,723
We're going in! Go, go, move!

1588
02:23:02,483 --> 02:23:04,147
He didn't do anything wrong.

1589
02:23:07,068 --> 02:23:11,917
Because he's the hero Gotham deserves,
but not the one it needs right now.

1590
02:23:13,734 --> 02:23:19,655
So we'll hunt him, because he can take it.

1591
02:23:22,641 --> 02:23:24,730
Because he's not a hero.

1592
02:23:32,742 --> 02:23:37,187
He's a silent guardian, a watchful protector.

1593
02:23:39,500 --> 02:23:41,185
A dark knight.
